[{"doc": {"id": "13076069", "uri": "Q936758", "title": "Jean Martin", "text": "Jean Martin (6 March 1922 \u2013 2 February 2009) was a French actor of stage and screen. Martin served in the French Resistance during World War II and later fought with the French paratroopers in Indochina. Theatrically, he is perhaps best known for originating two roles in Samuel Beckett's most famous plays: Lucky in \"Waiting for Godot\", and Clov in \"Endgame\". During the 1950s, he was a performer at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire and also worked for radio plays.\n\nMaking over eighty film and television appearances, Martin is probably best remembered by international audiences for his role as the French paratroop commander Col. Mathieu in \"The Battle of Algiers\" (1965), as the gunslinger Sullivan in Sergio Leone's \"My Name is Nobody\" and as the laconic OAS adjutant Viktor Wolenski in \"The Day of the Jackal\" (both 1973). He had one of the lead roles in the 1968 French mini-series \"Les Compagnons de Baal\".\n\nMost of his other screen work was in French or European cinema, though his stage performances gained him much more recognition and acclaim. Martin was also an active political leftist, and was fired from the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire for signing the manifesto of the 121 against the Algerian War. He was also blacklisted from radio work and remained unemployed for a time as a result.\n\nMartin was hired for \"The Battle of Algiers\" because director Gillo Pontecorvo was looking for a little-known professional actor to play the part of Col. Mathieu. Martin had by then worked extensively on stage, but had done just a few appearances on screen. Enjoying movie work and wishing to develop his film career, Martin tried for the part and was hired. Martin later explained that his working relationship with Pontecorvo on the set of \"The Battle of Algiers\" was often difficult, as the director otherwise hired non-professional actors for the film. Martin, as the film's only professional actor, was sometimes uncomfortable working with untrained performers, while Pontecorvo was worried that their acting styles might be too different from each other and work against the picture. Martin was ultimately very happy with the film.\n\nJean Martin continued working on stage and on screen, playing a variety of supporting roles in French films and television productions. He also provided the voice of L'oiseau in the animation feature film \"Le Roi et l'oiseau\".\n\nMartin died from cancer in Paris on 2 February 2009, aged 86."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Jean Martin", "description": "French actor known for his stage performances and for his roles in \"The Battle of Algiers\", \"My Name is Nobody\", and \"The Day of the Jackal\"", "types": ["Actor", "Stage performer", "Resistance fighter", "Paratrooper", "Voice actor", "Political activist"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true, true, true, true], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "French Resistance", "description": "A resistance movement that fought against the German occupation of France during World War II", "types": ["Resistance movement", "World War II"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true, false], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "World War II", "description": "A global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 and involved the majority of the world's nations", "types": ["War", "Global conflict"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true, true], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "French paratroopers", "description": "French soldiers trained to parachute from airplanes into combat zones", "types": ["Military unit", "Paratrooper"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true, true], "rebel match": false}}, {"label": "Samuel Beckett", "description": "Irish playwright and novelist known for his works such as \"Waiting for Godot\" and \"Endgame\"", "types": ["Playwright", "Novelist"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true, true], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "Lucky", "description": "A character in Samuel Beckett's play \"Waiting for Godot\"", "types": ["Fictional character", "Play character"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "Waiting for Godot", "description": "A play by Samuel Beckett in which two characters, Vladimir and Estragon, wait for the arrival of someone named Godot", "types": ["Play", "Theatre"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true, false], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "Clov", "description": "A character in Samuel Beckett's play \"Endgame\"", "types": ["Fictional character", "Play character"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true], "rebel match": false}}, {"label": "Endgame", "description": "A play by Samuel Beckett in which the characters Hamm and Clov are trapped in a room and engage in a series of conversations", "types": ["Play", "Theatre"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true, false], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire", "description": "A French theatre company founded in 1920", "types": ["Theatre company", "Performing arts"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true, false], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "Radio plays", "description": "A form of audio storytelling broadcast on radio", "types": ["Audio drama", "Broadcasting"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [false, false], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "The Battle of Algiers", "description": "A 1965 film about the Algerian War, directed by Gillo Pontecorvo", "types": ["Film", "War drama"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "Col.

He was preceded by his father Mehmed I Giray (r. 1515\u20131523) and was followed by his uncle Saadet I Girai (r.\u00a01524\u20131532). He was enthroned after his father's murder and was executed by his uncle. In the nine years following Mehmed's death the throne was contested Mehmed\u2019s sons Gazi and Islam and his brothers Saadet and Sahib until Mehmed's brother Sahib I Giray (1532\u20131551) achieved a long reign.\n\nIn 1523 his father Mehmed took over the Khanate of Astrakhan and placed Gazy\u2019s brother Bakhadyr on the throne. Mehmed\u2019s Nogai allies, fearing his growing power, killed him and Bakhadyr. Gazy and his brother Baba fled back to Crimea with a few men. They were followed by a large Nogai army which looted much of Crimea except for the mountains and fortified cities. The Crimean nobles gathered 12000 men and attacked the Nogais. They were defeated and withdrew to Perekop which then had a Turkish garrison. At the same time Cossacks under Kanev starost Evstafy Dashkevich raided and destroyed the fortress of Ochakov. The Nogais then returned to the steppe with their loot. \n\nSince Gazy was the eldest surviving son of Mehmed he was chosen khan (autumn 1523). He chose his brother Baba as Kalga. He quickly lost the support of the great nobles. Led by Memish Bey of the Shirin clan, they appealed to the Turks. The Shirin Bey personally went to Istanbul and asked that Saadet be brought back to Crimea. In the spring of 1524 Saadet landed with Turkish troops and took the throne.\n\nThere are different stories of Gazi\u2019s death. According of Gaivoronsky Saadet murdered him of their first meeting and imprisoned his brothers Baba and Choban. Halim-Giray-Sultan says that Saadat made Gazi kalga and killed him and Baba three months later. Howorth, writing in 1880, says that the Shirins tried to prevent a civil war by making Saadat Khan and Gazi Kalga. When Gazi was about to take the oath of allegiance he was murdered."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "\u011eaz\u0131 I Giray", "description": "Former khan of the Crimean khanate who ruled for six

It was constructed over a ten-year period, from 1830 to 1840, on a site which had been occupied for some 4,000 years and which from the 11th century until the dissolution of the monasteries was an abbey.\n\nAlthough called a \"castle\", the building is really a large comfortable country house, one of many \"mock\" castles built in the 19th century during the Gothic Revival.\n\nAfter making a Grand Tour of Europe as a young man, Talbot returned to south Wales and from 1830 he set about redeveloping the family estate at Margam. The new castle was designed in a Tudor Gothic style by the architect Thomas Hopper (1776\u20131856), while Edward Haycock Snr (1790\u20131870) was supervisory architect and designed parts of the interior and exterior of the house, the stables, terraces and lodges. Talbot also took a keen interest in the project, encouraging his architects to borrow elements from Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire (ancestral home of the Talbots and home to his cousin William Henry Fox Talbot) and Melbury House in Dorset (home of his mother's family, the Fox-Strangways, Earls of Ilchester).\n\nWilliam Henry Fox Talbot was a frequent visitor to Margam, and the castle featured as an image in some of his early photographic experiments. Margam's links with photography also include being the location of the earliest known Welsh photograph, a daguerreotype of the castle taken on 9 March 1841 by the Reverend Calvert Richard Jones.\n\nAfter the death of Emily Charlotte Talbot, the daughter of its first owner, the castle passed to her nephew and continued to be used by the Talbot family until 1941, when it was sold. David Evans-Bevan, who bought it, found it too large to live in, but could not find any public organisation interested in taking it on, and it fell into disrepair. For many years it belonged to the local authority, but was not open to the public. In 1977, a fire caused substantial damage, and it was only after this that a restoration project began in earnest.\n\nIt has become a very popular venue for paranormal investigation events groups. In 2013 the Margam Ghost Walk (which seeks to explain the stories of the reputed hauntings but which does not undertake paranormal investigation) became the most popular attraction in the Neath Port Talbot authority area, according to the review website Tripadvisor. \n\nToday Margam Castle is a Grade I listed building and is in the care of Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council."}, "entities":

Because all its diameters are the same, the Reuleaux triangle is one answer to the question \"Other than a circle, what shape can a manhole cover be made so that it cannot fall down through the hole?\"\n\nReuleaux triangles have also been called spherical triangles, but that term more properly refers to triangles on the curved surface of a sphere.\nThey are named after Franz Reuleaux, a 19th-century German engineer who pioneered the study of machines for translating one type of motion into another, and who used Reuleaux triangles in his designs. However, these shapes were known before his time, for instance by the designers of Gothic church windows, by Leonardo da Vinci, who used it for a map projection, and by Leonhard Euler in his study of constant-width shapes. Other applications of the Reuleaux triangle include giving the shape to guitar picks, fire hydrant nuts, pencils, and drill bits for drilling square holes, as well as in graphic design in the shapes of some signs and corporate logos.\n\nAmong constant-width shapes with a given width, the Reuleaux triangle has the minimum area and the sharpest (smallest) possible angle (120\u00b0) at its corners. By several numerical measures it is the farthest from being centrally symmetric. It provides the largest constant-width shape avoiding the points of an integer lattice, and is closely related to the shape of the quadrilateral maximizing the ratio of perimeter to diameter. It can perform a complete rotation within a square while at all times touching all four sides of the square, and has the smallest possible area of shapes with this property. However, although it covers most of the square in this rotation process, it fails to cover a small fraction of the square's area, near its corners. Because of this property of rotating within a square, the Reuleaux triangle is also sometimes known as the Reuleaux rotor.\n\nThe Reuleaux triangle is the first of a sequence of Reuleaux polygons whose boundaries are curves of constant width formed from regular polygons with an odd number of sides. Some of these curves have been used as the shapes of coins. The Reuleaux triangle can also be generalized into three dimensions in multiple ways: the Reuleaux tetrahedron (the intersection of four balls whose centers lie on a regular tetrahedron) does not have constant width, but can be modified by rounding its edges to form the Meissner tetrahedron, which does. Alternatively, the surface of revolution of the Reuleaux triangle also has constant width."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Reuleaux triangle", "description": "A shape formed from the intersection

It runs from Bank Street in the south to Industrial Avenue in the north covering the neighbourhoods of Ridgemont, Alta Vista and Riverview.\n\nAlta Vista was created as the result of major residential developments (notably the Rideau Park and Alta Vista subdivisions) in the region following World War II. First referred to as the \"100 foot highway\", was renamed Churchill Avenue (after Winston Churchill) in 1941. It became \"Alta Vista Drive\" in July 1950 as the result of Ottawa annexing that part of Gloucester Township (there was already a Churchill Avenue in Ottawa). The first stretch was built between Smyth Road and Kilborn Avenue in 1939. Gloucester Township Council passed a by-law on May 3, 1937 permitting its construction. The stretch from Kilborn to Randall was built in 1940; the stretch north of Smyth in 1942 (to what is now Terminal Avenue) and south of Randall to Bank Street (then called \"Metcalfe Road\") in 1947.\n\nAlta Vista originally ran past Industrial and connected with the Vanier Parkway, but the intersection, which also involved Riverside Drive was re-aligned in 1986. Furthermore, in the 1990s, Alta Vista gained bicycle lanes along its entire stretch. Alta Vista is so named for its general height, as the neighbourhoods it runs through are generally higher than the rest of the city (the name means \"a view from above\" or \"high view\" in Spanish and Portuguese). The name was first applied to the area in 1913, for a small subdivision built on the north side of Randall Avenue which had a good view of Parliament Hill.\n\nFor the most part, Alta Vista runs through residential areas, and it is a two to four-lane minor arterial road, with a speed limit of . The area consists mostly of single-home houses, with the exception of three apartment-style, low-rent buildings named the \"Alta Vista Towers\" located in the north near Industrial Avenue and the Alta Vista Plaza. Alta Vista Drive consists of mixed housing, ranging from small modest houses in the northern parts, to more expensive, small Colonial-style houses and bungalows in the area immediately south to Smyth Road.\n\nThe road is characterized by large trees along both sides and the Via Rail train track running parallel between Alta Vista Drive and Riverside Drive from Industrial Avenue to Smyth Road.\n\nAlta Vista is home to the National Defence Medical Centre, Canadian Pharmacists Association, Canadian Blood Services, Canadian Dental Association, Ontario Medical Association, the Canadian Medical Association, and its affiliate MD Management, and the Conference Board of Canada, located in the area north of the Smyth Road intersection in a stretch of the road that is not residential, as well as Ridgemont High School and St. Patrick's High School located south from Smyth Road. The area is home to the Anglican Church St. Thomas the Apostle, the United Church Rideau Park, and the Presbyterian Church St. Timothy's.

system administrators, software developers, and other technical users of the Apple Macintosh line of computers.\n\nThe magazine was called \"MacTech\" for its first two issues, starting in 1984, after which its name was changed to MacTutor. At the time the magazine defined itself as \"a technical publication devoted to advancing programming knowledge of the Macintosh for both hacker and professional alike\". \n\nIn the spring of 1989 a new and separate magazine called MacTech was launched by TechAlliance, a global Apple users group headquartered in Renton, WA that hosted the Apple Programmers and Developers Association (APDA). The founding editor of MacTech was Andrew Himes, and Himes described the magazine as \"The journal designed by people who program and develop for the Apple Macintosh. You hold in your hands what is designed to be a legendary publication for a legendary computer. In these wee, early hours of the computer revolution, just a scant half decade after the introduction of Apple's flagship computer, the world needs a magazine that focuses on the needs of the Mac developer community with the intensity, vision, and utility of no other existing publication. Nuts-and-bolts programming solutions and tutorials. In-depth looks at future technologies and present opportunities. An emphasis on both object-oriented and proceduarl languages, on database programming and spreadsheet macros, on HyperTalking and multimedia applications. Feature articles, tutorials, reviews, and commentary by some of the most important, creative, and eloquent programmers in the Macintosh universe. MacTech will be preeminently useful and intellectually provocative. An essential desktop reference for today's serious programmers, as well as a tool that will help pave your way to the future of programming.\" \n\nIn 1993, \"MacTutor Magazine\" purchased \"MacTech\", and the name of the consolidated publication became MacTech.\n\nIn 2010, \"MacTech\" launched its event series -- first with MacTech Conference, then MacTech Boot Camp and then MacTech InDepth. 2010 had a single event, 2011 had seven events, and 2012 has fifteen events.\n\nMacTech.com also provides a news aggregator service.\n\nThe magazine is privately owned, held by Xplain Corporation.\n\nOn June 5, 2008, MacTech announced it would act as caretaker to the archives of MacMinute News and Forums. At these forums, Stan's Lounge is crowded with MacMinute and MacCentral faithful in honor of Stan Flack's contributions to the Macintosh community.\n\nOn November 6, 2009, MacTech announced that it was acquiring MacMod, a community site dedicated to modding Apple hardware and software. As part of the acquisition, the MacMod forums have been integrated into MacTech's, and MacTech now has a podcast dedicated to Mac technical topics as well as industry news, event coverage, and interviews."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "MacTech", "description": "A monthly magazine for technical users of Apple Macintosh computers.", "types": ["Magazine", "Technology", "Apple"],

He began playing hard rock guitar at age 13, but gravitated into classical after finding an ad for classical guitar lessons in a school trash can. Frasca originally entered the University of Arizona with the intent of studying classical guitar, but realized after a year that it wasn't his style. Leaving the University of Arizona after his scholarship for classical guitar was canceled, he enrolled in colleges in Ohio, also trying Yale University, where he first met composer Marc Mellits. The friendship and collaboration did not begin until Mellits and Frasca met once more, through a mutual friend at Cornell University.\n\nSeeking to perfect his art, Frasca had an extensive practice routine, often spending up to 14 hours a day playing. While it initially added to his abilities, the rigorousness took its toll; Frasca developed focal dystonia\u2014the loss of motor control in his fingers. He spent two years seeking treatment for the condition, unable to play at all. Frasca turned to weight training as a source of help. By keeping a balance between his practice and working out, he regained full use of his hands in 2003.\n\nHe is probably best known for his customized ten-string guitar, which allows him to create a unique, layered sound normally only accomplishable using multiple instruments or post-recording techniques such as overdubbing.\n\nFrasca's technique incorporates classical guitar technique in the right hand as well as rock techniques such as tapping, hammer-ons, and pull-offs in the left hand. But Frasca has also expanded beyond these traditional techniques by inventing and creating other techniques to meet specific needs or problems presented by a specific composition. These include the use of a prepared guitar, with single string \"mini-capos\", the addition of pads on the body of the guitar (which Frasca uses for a myriad of percussion sounds and timbres), and attached sticks and levers on the body of the guitar, used to create percussive sounds. \"All my inspiration comes from ensembles,\" Frasca says. \"Most notably The Philip Glass Ensemble, Steve Reich and Musicians, Anthony Davis and Episteme, The Who, The \u00c1stor Piazzolla Quintet, and Led Zeppelin to name a few.\" \"It always bothered me that when I would go to a classical guitar concert I would often leave knowing nothing about the person I just spent two hours listening to. I want people to know who I am and I want to know who my audience is- the most fundamental way that people communicate is by discovery.\"\n\nFrasca has been called \"Eddie Van Halen for eggheads\" by \"Entertainment Weekly\". He is currently signed with Canataloupe Music and has released two albums, entitled \"Deviations\", and \"Forced Entry\".\n\nIn 2005, Frasca opened a small, high-tech, surround-sound nightclub in New York City named \"The Monkey\", which he has described as \"a space that is all about the music, the sound and the visuals, not about selling drinks.\" The performance space is on the 12th floor of a building."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Dominic Frasca", "description": "A guitarist known for his unique sound and customized ten-string guitar.", "types": ["Musician", "Guitarist", "Composer"],

Generally similar to the Castle class naval trawlers of 1916-18, though somewhat larger, they were mainly used on minesweeping and harbour defence duties. Most were armed with one 12-pounder gun (76mm) and three or four 20 mm Oerlikon AA guns with 30 depth charges. In the Dance class a 4-inch AA gun (102\u00a0mm) was fitted in place of the 12-pdr, and there were six 20\u00a0mm Oerlikons in \"Annet\", \"Bressay\", \"Damsay\", \"Fiaray\", \"Foulness\" and \"Lindisfarne\". Four of the trawlers were given 'Bird' names when converted to controlled minelayers in 1943-44: \"Blackbird\" (M15), \"Dabchick\" (M22), \"Stonechat\" (M25) and \"Whitethroat\" (M03). A total of 23 of these trawlers were lost during the war. Six trawlers were loaned to Canada in 1942-45 and five to Norway in 1943-45.\n\nPostwar, 17 of the trawlers were disarmed as wreck disposal vessels: \"Bardsey\" (DV13), \"Bern\" (DV4), \"Caldy\" (DV5) \"Coll\" (DV6), \"Earraid\" (DV7), \"Fetlar\" (DV8), \"Flatholm\" (DV9), \"Graemsay\" (DV10), \"Lindisfarne\" (DV11), \"Lundy\" (DV12), \"Neave\" (DV14), \"Scalpay\" (DV15), \"Skomer\" (DV16), \"Steepholm\" (DV17), \"Switha\" (DV18), \"Tiree\" (DV19), and \"Trondra\" (DV20). At least five were employed as danlayers (laying and retrieving dan buoys during minesweeping operations): \"Imersay\" (J422), \"Sandray\" (J424), \"Shillay\" (J426), \"Sursay\" (J427) and \"Tocogay\" (J451). After decommissioning, \"Switha\" and \"Coll\" were converted to oil tank cleaning vessels for dockyard service in 1949-50.\n\nBy 1949 there remained in service of this type 31 trawlers and four controlled minelayers in the Royal Navy, one controlled minelayer in the Royal Canadian Navy, and four trawlers in the Royal New Zealand Navy. An additional 16 were in service in the Italian Navy and six in the Portuguese Navy. Most of the surviving Royal Navy examples were discarded in the 1950s, but a few remained until the 1960s. Two acquired postwar by the Federal German Navy remained in service as training vessels well into the 1970s, with one, \"Trave\" (ex-\"Dochet\"), resold to Turkey for further service in 1977."},

In the first election held after the end of World War I and the first election after the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, Republican Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio defeated Democratic Governor James M. Cox of Ohio.\n\nIncumbent Democratic President Woodrow Wilson privately hoped for a third term, but party leaders were unwilling to re-nominate the ailing and unpopular incumbent. Former President Theodore Roosevelt had been the front-runner for the Republican nomination, but he died in 1919 without leaving an obvious heir to his progressive legacy. With both Wilson and Roosevelt out of the running, the major parties turned to little-known dark horse candidates from the state of Ohio, a swing state with a large number of electoral votes. Cox won the 1920 Democratic National Convention on the 44th ballot, defeating William Gibbs McAdoo (Wilson's son-in-law), A. Mitchell Palmer, and several other candidates. Harding emerged as a compromise candidate between the conservative and progressive wings of the party, and he clinched his nomination on the tenth ballot of the 1920 Republican National Convention.\n\nThe election was dominated by the American social and political environment in the aftermath of World War I, which was marked by a hostile response to certain aspects of Wilson's foreign policy and a massive reaction against the reformist zeal of the Progressive Era. The wartime economic boom had collapsed and the country was deep in a recession. Wilson's advocacy for America's entry into the League of Nations in the face of a return to non-interventionist opinion challenged his effectiveness as president, and overseas there were wars and revolutions. At home, the year 1919 was marked by major strikes in the meatpacking and steel industries and large-scale race riots in Chicago and other cities. Anarchist attacks on Wall Street produced fears of radicals and terrorists. The Irish Catholic and German communities were outraged at Wilson's perceived favoritism of their traditional enemy Great Britain, and his political position was critically weakened after he suffered a stroke in 1919 that left him severely disabled.\n\nHarding all but ignored Cox in the race and essentially campaigned against Wilson by calling for a \"return to normalcy\". Harding won a landslide victory, sweeping every state outside of the South and becoming the first Republican since the end of Reconstruction to win a former state of the Confederacy, Tennessee. Harding's victory margin of 26.2% in the popular vote remains the largest popular-vote percentage margin in presidential elections since the unopposed re-election of James Monroe in 1820, though other candidates have since exceeded his share of the popular vote. Cox won just 34.1% of the popular vote, and Socialist Eugene V. Debs won 3.4%, despite being in prison at the time. It was also the first election in which women had the right to vote in all 48 states, which caused the total popular vote to increase dramatically, from 18.5 million in 1916 to 26.8 million in 1920. Both vice presidential nominees would eventually become president in their own right: Harding would pass away in 1923 and be succeeded by Vice President Calvin Coolidge, while the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Franklin D. Roosevelt, would eventually win an unprecedented four consecutive presidential elections starting in 1932."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "1920 United States presidential election", "description": "A quadrennial election in which Republican Senator Warren G.

To be successful, the skydiver must catch the parachute, secure it, and glide to the projected landing zone. There is no known, credible evidence that a banzai skydive has ever really occurred according to its definition.\n\nThere have however been multiple recorded instances of skydivers jumping without being attached to a parachute. However these jumps lack the element that make them a banzai skydive, where a parachute is thrown out of the plane then caught by the jumper after some delay. During skydives where the jumper is detached from the skydiving rig the rig is held by the skydiver or an assistant until the skydiver is secured to the rig. This is due to the skydiving rig having a much slower terminal velocity than a skydiver is capable of achieving. This has led the skydiving community to doubt the idea that banzai skydiving has ever occurred as defined.\n\nSkydivers jumping while detached from a rig wear a special harness that attaches to a cord extending from the parachute. The cord can be clearly seen in Andreas Dachtler's jump video taken in Southeast Europe. This ensures the skydiver can safely recover the parachute. Otherwise, the legstraps on a normal harness would require a thread through. This would be impossible while in free fall.\n\nThe banzai skydive is the most dangerous category in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\", according to Editor Craig Glenday. Yasuhiro Kubo took the challenge on September 2, 2000. Kubo supposedly fell alongside the rig for 50 seconds after jumping before regaining and deploying his parachute. Details about the jump are sparse and it is unknown whether Kubo or another skydiver held onto the rig while falling. This won him a place in the Guinness World Records. This claim however was not witnessed by a Guinness Book of World Records official, but was witnessed by an unknown expert. No video or photographic evidence exists to support the claim.\n\nThe Banzai skydiving category is still accepted in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\". Guinness cannot accept a record claim that is likely to put people at risk other than the person attempting the world record. As long as the Banzai skydive guidelines are followed, nobody is at risk. The guidelines state that the jump must be done away from public places."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Banzai skydiving", "description": "A rumored form of skydiving where the skydiver throws

This met during a disturbed period in Scotland's history. The Church, in particular, was trying to establish its independence of King James VI and the civil courts. The highlight of the meeting was when they defied a deputation of Lords of Session. They wished to try the case of the Minister of Stirling whose reputation had been called into question in a civil case. A man charged with forgery had confessed to the Minister, but now wished to say the Minister had misused his position to get him to do so. The case was before the Court of Session and it, the King and the Lords of Session did not want the Assembly to interfere. The Assembly was not intimidated and proceeded to examine - and clear - the minister. Nicol Dalgleish presided over these debates.\n\nNicol was born about 1560. His brother was a merchant in Inverness so he may have originated in, or had connections with that city. He is mentioned as having been a Regent (or \"teacher\") in St Leonard's College in the University of St Andrews, so he most likely studied there. In 1582 he is mentioned as being a Minister in the \"Collegiate Charge\" of St Cuthbert's Church in Edinburgh. In 1582 he was tried for his life, accused of supporting rebel clergy who had fled from the King. He was acquitted, was tried again. This time it was for corresponding with the rebels - one (partisan) source says that he had merely looked at a letter one of the rebels had written home to his wife. He was sentenced to death, but this was not carried out. It was reported that the scaffold that had been prepared for him was left standing outside his home for several weeks.\n\nHe was appointed Chaplain to the Earl of Angus in the early summer of 1586, and left St Cuthbert\u2019s in October of that year. Unfortunately, the Earl died two years later (in 1588) and Nicol had to find another living. He was licensed by the Assembly to find himself some other parish, as \"\"he could not continue for lack of provisioun, 12 July 1586, and had ane testimoniall from the haill parochin\"\n\nIn fact, his St Andrews contacts may have helped. James Melville was the nephew of Andrew Melville, both connected to St Andrews University. James Melville as Principal of the University controlled a number of appointments to parishes, among them one to a post that involved four separate churches - Kilrenny, Anstruther, Pittenweem and Abercrombie. He wanted to establish them as separate parishes with good, reliable (protestant) ministers. He offered Nicol Dalgleish the Pittenweem post, along with an old priory, which had also once belonged to the University"}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Nicol Dalgleish", "description": "Moderator

"Q5344215", "title": "Edward Lovett", "text": "Edward Lovett (July 1852 \u2013 1933) was an English folklorist, recognised for his collections of charms, amulets, and objects used in children's games.\n\nHe was born in Islington and lived in Outram Road, Croydon, later residing in Caterham, and is reported to have worked as a chief cashier at branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland in the City of London. Lovett spent his spare time collecting, writing, and lecturing on folk-lore, usually focused on objects he had collected on his walks around London, Sussex and Surrey. \n\nLovett was married and had at least two children. His oldest son served in the First World War. \n\nAfter his retirement in 1912, he dedicated himself full time to this endeavor, and to sharing his love of alpine plants. An early work, self-published, is \"How to Make A Rock Garden and Grow Alpine Plants\", not dated, but presumably around 1900. The two interests overlapped when Lovett was able to exchange small alpine specimens, grown in seashells, for amulets and charms from the people he met in London. \n\nHe also reports having made collections in Belgium and Holland. Lovett's exhibitions in England and Wales were reviewed in the national press, some becoming permanent exhibits, and donated many objects to the Pitt Rivers Museum between 1896 and 1911. He lectured at many schools, colleges, special interest groups and societies, and reached a wide public through regular articles in local papers, describing contemporary superstitions and beliefs.\n\nAn article in the Museum's Journal in 1906 set out Lovett's vision for a folk museum of Britain, and he continued to collect and campaign with this aim in mind, until the early 1920s.\n\nIn 1914, Edward Lovett displayed over 500 dolls at the National Museum of Wales, with the intention of entertaining children and presenting to adults a \"scientific history of the doll, from the standpoints of ethnography and folklore\". Lovett's interest in dolls as idols, or miniature representations, led him to the theory that the dolls in coffins found on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh in the 1830s were substitution burials for sailors lost at sea. This theory has not been supported by recent scholarship.\n\nOver his long career collecting folklore, Lovett corresponded with many museum curators and collectors, including Henry Wellcome. The exhibition 'Folklore of London', curated by Lovett, was held at the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum in 1916.\n\nDuring the late 1880s he served as President of the Croydon Microscopical and Natural History Club. After joining the Folklore Society in 1900, he presented it with talks and published papers in its \"Journal\". Lovett did not venture into theorising on folklore, confining his research to the collection of talismans and other objects with superstitious claims. A major work, \"Magic in Modern London\", was published in 1925. \n\nEdward Lovett's donations can be found in many museums, including the Cuming Museum in Southwark, the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford, the V&A Museum of Childhood, and the Museum of Childhood in Edinburgh (on long term loan from the National Museum of Wales).\n\nAn exhibition \"Charmed Life: The solace of objects\" held at the Wellcome Collection from 6 October 2011 to 26 February 2012, displayed many of Lovett's amulets alongside contemporary films and medals by artist and curator Felicity Powell."},

He was a descendant of Rev. Thomas Hooker, first minister of Hartford, Connecticut He fitted for college under the direction of Rev. Joab Brace, D. D., at Newington, Connecticut and graduated from Yale College in 1815. After graduating, he was for about two years Principal of the Hartford Grammar School, from which he was called to be Tutor in Yale College, which office he held from 1817 to 1822. During this time he studied theology and was licensed to preach the gospel.\n\nIn the year 1822, he was ordained as pastor of the Congregational Church in Watertown, Connecticut, where he remained about two years, being then compelled to resign his pastorate on account of ill-health. In 1824 he returned to Hartford and became editor of the \"Connecticut Observer\", a religious newspaper, which he conducted with ability for many years. He also held the office of Secretary of the Missionary Society of Connecticut, from 1826, and of the Connecticut Home Missionary Society, from 1831 till his death.\n\nIn 1852, he was appointed Chaplain of the Retreat for the Insane, performing the duties of that office until incapacitated by an attack of paralysis in August, 1862. For several years previous to 1855, he spent his leisure time in the preparation of books for children. Among these were \"Child's Book on the Sabbath\", \"The Farmer\", \"Prophets and Prophecy\", and four volumes of \"Scripture Biography\". In connection with Rev. Dr. Gallaudet, he prepared \"The Practical Spelling Book,\" and \"The School and Family Dictionary.\" With the assistance of Rev. Dr. Daggett, he selected and arranged the \"Hymns and Psalms,\" as set forth by the General Association of Connecticut, in use for twenty years past in most of the Congregational Churches in this State. Mr. Hooker was a clear thinker, and expressed his thoughtfulness in a style remarkable for its neatness and perspicuity.\n\nHe married, July 17, 1822, Mary Ann Brown, who died May 3, 1838, without children. He married Harriet Watkinson, Nov 22, 1843, who survived him. He died in Hartford, December 17, 1864, aged 71 years.

Belonging to the Hanbali school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence, of which he is regarded as \"one of the most important thinkers,\" Ibn al-Qayyim is today best remembered as the foremost disciple and student of the controversial fourteenth-century Sunni theologian Ibn Taymiyyah, with whom he was imprisoned in 1326 for dissenting against established tradition during Ibn Taymiyyah's famous incarceration in the Citadel of Damascus.\n\nOf humble origin, Ibn al-Qayyim's father was the principal (\"qayyim\") of the School of Jawziyya, which also served as a court of law for the Hanbali judge of Damascus during the time period. Ibn al-Qayyim went on to become a prolific scholar, producing a rich corpus of \"doctrinal and literary\" works. As a result, numerous important Muslim scholars of the Mamluk period were among Ibn al-Qayyim's students or, at least, greatly influenced by him, including, amongst others, the Shafi historian Ibn Kathir (d. 774/1373), the Hanbali hadith scholar Ibn Rajab (d. 795/1397), and the Shafi polymath Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d. 852/1449). In the present day, Ibn al-Qayyim's name has become a controversial one in certain quarters of the Islamic world due to his popularity amongst many adherents of the Sunni movements of Salafism and Wahhabism, who see in his criticisms of such widespread orthodox Sunni practices of the medieval period as the veneration of saints and the veneration of their graves and relics a classical precursor to their own perspective."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Shams al-D\u012bn Ab\u016b \u02bfAbd All\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Ab\u012b Bakr ibn Ayy\u016bb al-Zur\u02bf\u012b l-Dimashq\u012b

[\u05f4Jenny\u05f4] (November 30, 1918 \u2013 March 7, 2001) was a pitcher and utility who played from through in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at , 122\u00a0lb., she batted and threw right-handed.\n\nJanice O'Hara was one of the sixty original players to join the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League for its inaugural season. A valuable and versatile player, she had an array of pitches that kept the hitters guessing, and also played several positions competently during her seven years in the league.\n\nBorn in Beardstown, Illinois, O'Hara started playing organized softball in Springfield in her teen years, until AAGPBL scout Eddie Stumpf interviewed her and sent her to the final tryout at Wrigley Field in Chicago. In the process, she was signed a contract and joined the Kenosha Comets, playing for them her entire career in the league.\n\nComets manager Josh Billings used O'Hara at first base and she hit a respectable .187 average and posted career-numbers in hits (63), triples (6), runs (46) and RBI (28), helping Kenosha win the second half of the 1943 season. The team faced first-half winner Racine Belles in the best-of-five series and was shut out in three games.\n\nBy 1944, new manager Marty McManus turned O'Hara into a utility player. She collected a personal-high 37 stolen bases and belted the only home run of her career in that season. After that, she mostly played at first base and in the outfield, but also filled at second base and third base through the 1946 season.\n\nIn 1947 O'Hara was converted into a pitcher by then manager Ralph Shinners. In her repertoire she included a fastball, a curve and specially a knuckleball, which she loved to use. She turned in a 6\u20138 record with a 3.51 earned run average in 21 appearances. The next year she went 4\u20136 in 20 games while lowering her ERA to 3.20. Used sparingly in 1949, she had a 2\u20133 mark and a 4.65 ERA in 11 games.\n\nIn a seven-year career, O'Hara posted a 13\u201317 record and a 3.56 ERA in 55 games. As a hitter, she batted a .199 average in 309 games. In three postseason appearances, she batted .130 (3-for-23) in seven games and hurled six innings of shutout ball for a perfect 0.00 ERA.\n\nFollowing her baseball career, O'Hara worked as an accountant for 31 years and retired in 1982. She later spent her time in the garden and attended AAGPBL Players Association reunions. The association was largely responsible for the opening of \"Women in Baseball\", a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.\n\nJanice O'Hara died in 2001 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the age of 82."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Janice Winifred O'Hara

During 1858, they moved to Jack County, Texas and settled on Boone's Creek, in the southwestern part of the county.\n\nOn October 26, 1863, during the early afternoon, J. H. Tackitt, a son of Mann Tackitt, went out in a southwesterly direction in search of stock. Shortly afterwards, his father, who was armed with a double-barrel gun, went north for the same purpose. Tackitt's gun was loaded with a ball on one side, and a buck shot on the other. He was also armed with a pistol. When he had gone only about one mile from his home, he found himself surrounded by fifteen or twenty savage Indians. At first he made an attempt, to run home. But since his best horses had been stolen by the Indians, the Indians soon overtook him. Tackitt then dismounted to sell his life as dearly as possible, at a point within one-half mile of his own residence. He fought the warriors away for some time, as was shown by the circular trail some distance from the tree, behind which Tackitt, perhaps, held the Indians at bay until he discharged all of his loads, for seven or eight shots were heard at the residence.\n\nWhen J.H. Tackett reached home, he was informed of the firing, and heard some of the shots himself. As a consequence, he and a younger brother, Caleb, went out in search of their father, and it seems that Caleb, previous to this, had made an attempt to offer his father some assistance, but realized that it was of no avail, for the Indians were still on the ground. \n\nIn a short time, J.H. and Caleb Tackett reached their father, who was already dead, stripped of a part of his clothing, but not scalped. His guns were gone, and many arrows were in the tree by which he stood, on the ground, and in his body. The boys hurried to the ranch for a wagon, notified the neighbors and arranged for a coffin to be made at Veal's Station where he was buried.\n\nA posse of citizens followed the Indian trail, and after going for, perhaps, half a mile, they found a dead savage, and indications disclosed others were wounded. The dead Indian was dragged to the Tackett ranch and stood against a tree some distance from the residence.\n\nMany years after the death of Mann Tackitt, the metal part of his old double barrel gun was found a short distance from where the fight occurred."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Mann Darius Tackitt", "description": "A man who lived in Texas in the mid-1800s", "types": ["Person", "Historical Figure"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "Pleasant Tackitt", "description": "The brother of Mann Darius Tackitt", "types": ["Person", "Historical Figure"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "Parker County", "description": "A county in Texas where Mann Darius Tackitt and Pleasant Tackitt lived", "types": ["Place", "Geographic Area"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "Weatherford, Texas", "description": "A city in Texas located near where Mann Darius Tackitt and Pleasant Tackitt lived", "types": ["Place", "Geographic Area"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "Jack County", "description": "A county in Texas where Mann Darius Tackitt and Pleasant Tackitt later settled", "types": ["Place", "Geographic Area"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true], "rebel match": true}}, {"label": "Boone's Creek", "description": "A creek in southwestern Jack County, Texas where Mann Darius Tackitt and Pleasant Tackitt settled", "types": ["Place", "Geographic Area"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true], "rebel match": false}}, {"label": "J.

As the fourth main installment and the 7th major console installment in the \"Rock Band\" franchise, it was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on October 6, 2015. Mad Catz, who also developed new instrument controllers for the game, marketed and distributed the title worldwide at launch; Performance Designed Products (PDP) took over manufacturing and distribution by the end of 2016. The game shipped with more than sixty licensed songs; additional songs are available as downloadable content, which includes a library of over 2000 existing songs from prior installments.\n\n\"Rock Band 4\" represented Harmonix's return to the franchise after an almost three-year hiatus, following the diminishing popularity of the rhythm game market that started in 2009. Announced on March 5, 2015, \"Rock Band 4\" refocuses on the core gameplay of the franchise, reducing the emphasis on musical instruction that was employed by its predecessor, \"Rock Band 3\", while emphasizing the game's social interactions, as well as new features enabling players to incorporate improvisation into their performance\u2014such as \"freestyle solos\" on guitar, and \"freeform melodies\" on multi-part vocals.\n\n\"Rock Band 4\" offers backward compatibility with content and hardware from previous versions of \"Rock Band\" within the same console family; wireless guitar and drum controllers from PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of \"Rock Band\" can be used on the PS4 and Xbox One versions (with PS4 using an existing USB dongle, and Xbox One requiring a newly produced USB dongle), and DLC songs purchased on prior installments on PS3 and Xbox 360 can be re-downloaded at no extra charge on PS4 and Xbox One in a ported form that supports the game's features. Harmonix plans to release free and paid DLC that will add new features and content to the game over time, in lieu of releasing yearly installments; this includes the addition of support for synchronous online play added on January 25, 2017.\n\nCritical reception to \"Rock Band 4\" on-launch was positive, with reviews praising the game for not significantly deviating from the gameplay mechanics of prior installments, as well as the higher degree of creative freedom offered by the Freestyle Solos feature, and its backward compatibility with previously-released content for the \"Rock Band\" franchise. The game was also criticized for lacking features present in previous versions, such as online multiplayer and practice modes."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Rock Band 4", "description": "A music
