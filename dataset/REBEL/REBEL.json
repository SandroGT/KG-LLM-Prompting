[{"doc": {"id": "13076069", "uri": "Q936758", "title": "Jean Martin", "text": "Jean Martin (6 March 1922 \u2013 2 February 2009) was a French actor of stage and screen. Martin served in the French Resistance during World War II and later fought with the French paratroopers in Indochina. Theatrically, he is perhaps best known for originating two roles in Samuel Beckett's most famous plays: Lucky in \"Waiting for Godot\", and Clov in \"Endgame\". During the 1950s, he was a performer at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire and also worked for radio plays.\n\nMaking over eighty film and television appearances, Martin is probably best remembered by international audiences for his role as the French paratroop commander Col. Mathieu in \"The Battle of Algiers\" (1965), as the gunslinger Sullivan in Sergio Leone's \"My Name is Nobody\" and as the laconic OAS adjutant Viktor Wolenski in \"The Day of the Jackal\" (both 1973). He had one of the lead roles in the 1968 French mini-series \"Les Compagnons de Baal\".\n\nMost of his other screen work was in French or European cinema, though his stage performances gained him much more recognition and acclaim. Martin was also an active political leftist, and was fired from the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire for signing the manifesto of the 121 against the Algerian War. He was also blacklisted from radio work and remained unemployed for a time as a result.\n\nMartin was hired for \"The Battle of Algiers\" because director Gillo Pontecorvo was looking for a little-known professional actor to play the part of Col. Mathieu. Martin had by then worked extensively on stage, but had done just a few appearances on screen. Enjoying movie work and wishing to develop his film career, Martin tried for the part and was hired. Martin later explained that his working relationship with Pontecorvo on the set of \"The Battle of Algiers\" was often difficult, as the director otherwise hired non-professional actors for the film. Martin, as the film's only professional actor, was sometimes uncomfortable working with untrained performers, while Pontecorvo was worried that their acting styles might be too different from each other and work against the picture. Martin was ultimately very happy with the film.\n\nJean Martin continued working on stage and on screen, playing a variety of supporting roles in French films and television productions. He also provided the voice of L'oiseau in the animation feature film \"Le Roi et l'oiseau\".\n\nMartin died from cancer in Paris on 2 February 2009, aged 86."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Jean Martin", "description": "French actor known for his stage performances and for his roles in \"The Battle of Algiers\", \"My Name is Nobody\", and \"The Day of the Jackal\"", "types": ["Actor", "Stage performer", "Resistance fighter", "Paratrooper", "Voice actor", "Political activist"]}, {"label": "French Resistance", "description": "A resistance movement that fought against the German occupation of France during World War II", "types": ["Resistance movement", "World War II"]}, {"label": "World War II", "description": "A global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 and involved the majority of the world's nations", "types": ["War", "Global conflict"]}, {"label": "French paratroopers", "description": "French soldiers trained to parachute from airplanes into combat zones", "types": ["Military unit", "Paratrooper"]}, {"label": "Samuel Beckett", "description": "Irish playwright and novelist known for his works such as \"Waiting for Godot\" and \"Endgame\"", "types": ["Playwright", "Novelist"]}, {"label": "Lucky", "description": "A character in Samuel Beckett's play \"Waiting for Godot\"", "types": ["Fictional character", "Play character"]}, {"label": "Waiting for Godot", "description": "A play by Samuel Beckett in which two characters, Vladimir and Estragon, wait for the arrival of someone named Godot", "types": ["Play", "Theatre"]}, {"label": "Clov", "description": "A character in Samuel Beckett's play \"Endgame\"", "types": ["Fictional character", "Play character"]}, {"label": "Endgame", "description": "A play by Samuel Beckett in which the characters Hamm and Clov are trapped in a room and engage in a series of conversations", "types": ["Play", "Theatre"]}, {"label": "Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire", "description": "A French theatre company founded in 1920", "types": ["Theatre company", "Performing arts"]}, {"label": "Radio plays", "description": "A form of audio storytelling broadcast on radio", "types": ["Audio drama", "Broadcasting"]}, {"label": "The Battle of Algiers", "description": "A 1965 film about the Algerian War, directed by Gillo Pontecorvo", "types": ["Film", "War drama"]}, {"label": "Col.

He was preceded by his father Mehmed I Giray (r. 1515\u20131523) and was followed by his uncle Saadet I Girai (r.\u00a01524\u20131532). He was enthroned after his father's murder and was executed by his uncle. In the nine years following Mehmed's death the throne was contested Mehmed\u2019s sons Gazi and Islam and his brothers Saadet and Sahib until Mehmed's brother Sahib I Giray (1532\u20131551) achieved a long reign.\n\nIn 1523 his father Mehmed took over the Khanate of Astrakhan and placed Gazy\u2019s brother Bakhadyr on the throne. Mehmed\u2019s Nogai allies, fearing his growing power, killed him and Bakhadyr. Gazy and his brother Baba fled back to Crimea with a few men. They were followed by a large Nogai army which looted much of Crimea except for the mountains and fortified cities. The Crimean nobles gathered 12000 men and attacked the Nogais. They were defeated and withdrew to Perekop which then had a Turkish garrison. At the same time Cossacks under Kanev starost Evstafy Dashkevich raided and destroyed the fortress of Ochakov. The Nogais then returned to the steppe with their loot. \n\nSince Gazy was the eldest surviving son of Mehmed he was chosen khan (autumn 1523). He chose his brother Baba as Kalga. He quickly lost the support of the great nobles. Led by Memish Bey of the Shirin clan, they appealed to the Turks. The Shirin Bey personally went to Istanbul and asked that Saadet be brought back to Crimea. In the spring of 1524 Saadet landed with Turkish troops and took the throne.\n\nThere are different stories of Gazi\u2019s death. According of Gaivoronsky Saadet murdered him of their first meeting and imprisoned his brothers Baba and Choban. Halim-Giray-Sultan says that Saadat made Gazi kalga and killed him and Baba three months later. Howorth, writing in 1880, says that the Shirins tried to prevent a civil war by making Saadat Khan and Gazi Kalga. When Gazi was about to take the oath of allegiance he was murdered."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "\u011eaz\u0131 I Giray", "description": "Former khan of the Crimean khanate who ruled for six

It was constructed over a ten-year period, from 1830 to 1840, on a site which had been occupied for some 4,000 years and which from the 11th century until the dissolution of the monasteries was an abbey.\n\nAlthough called a \"castle\", the building is really a large comfortable country house, one of many \"mock\" castles built in the 19th century during the Gothic Revival.\n\nAfter making a Grand Tour of Europe as a young man, Talbot returned to south Wales and from 1830 he set about redeveloping the family estate at Margam. The new castle was designed in a Tudor Gothic style by the architect Thomas Hopper (1776\u20131856), while Edward Haycock Snr (1790\u20131870) was supervisory architect and designed parts of the interior and exterior of the house, the stables, terraces and lodges. Talbot also took a keen interest in the project, encouraging his architects to borrow elements from Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire (ancestral home of the Talbots and home to his cousin William Henry Fox Talbot) and Melbury House in Dorset (home of his mother's family, the Fox-Strangways, Earls of Ilchester).\n\nWilliam Henry Fox Talbot was a frequent visitor to Margam, and the castle featured as an image in some of his early photographic experiments. Margam's links with photography also include being the location of the earliest known Welsh photograph, a daguerreotype of the castle taken on 9 March 1841 by the Reverend Calvert Richard Jones.\n\nAfter the death of Emily Charlotte Talbot, the daughter of its first owner, the castle passed to her nephew and continued to be used by the Talbot family until 1941, when it was sold. David Evans-Bevan, who bought it, found it too large to live in, but could not find any public organisation interested in taking it on, and it fell into disrepair. For many years it belonged to the local authority, but was not open to the public. In 1977, a fire caused substantial damage, and it was only after this that a restoration project began in earnest.\n\nIt has become a very popular venue for paranormal investigation events groups. In 2013 the Margam Ghost Walk (which seeks to explain the stories of the reputed hauntings but which does not undertake paranormal investigation) became the most popular attraction in the Neath Port Talbot authority area, according to the review website Tripadvisor. \n\nToday Margam Castle is a Grade I listed building and is in the care of Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council."}, "entities":

Its boundary is a curve of constant width, the simplest and best known such curve other than the circle itself. Constant width means that the separation of every two parallel supporting lines is the same, independent of their orientation. Because all its diameters are the same, the Reuleaux triangle is one answer to the question \"Other than a circle, what shape can a manhole cover be made so that it cannot fall down through the hole?\"\n\nReuleaux triangles have also been called spherical triangles, but that term more properly refers to triangles on the curved surface of a sphere.\nThey are named after Franz Reuleaux, a 19th-century German engineer who pioneered the study of machines for translating one type of motion into another, and who used Reuleaux triangles in his designs. However, these shapes were known before his time, for instance by the designers of Gothic church windows, by Leonardo da Vinci, who used it for a map projection, and by Leonhard Euler in his study of constant-width shapes. Other applications of the Reuleaux triangle include giving the shape to guitar picks, fire hydrant nuts, pencils, and drill bits for drilling square holes, as well as in graphic design in the shapes of some signs and corporate logos.\n\nAmong constant-width shapes with a given width, the Reuleaux triangle has the minimum area and the sharpest (smallest) possible angle (120\u00b0) at its corners. By several numerical measures it is the farthest from being centrally symmetric. It provides the largest constant-width shape avoiding the points of an integer lattice, and is closely related to the shape of the quadrilateral maximizing the ratio of perimeter to diameter. It can perform a complete rotation within a square while at all times touching all four sides of the square, and has the smallest possible area of shapes with this property. However, although it covers most of the square in this rotation process, it fails to cover a small fraction of the square's area, near its corners. Because of this property of rotating within a square, the Reuleaux triangle is also sometimes known as the Reuleaux rotor.\n\nThe Reuleaux triangle is the first of a sequence of Reuleaux polygons whose boundaries are curves of constant width formed from regular polygons with an odd number of sides. Some of these curves have been used as the shapes of coins. The Reuleaux triangle can also be generalized into three dimensions in multiple ways: the Reuleaux tetrahedron (the intersection of four balls whose centers lie on a regular tetrahedron) does not have constant width, but can be modified by rounding its edges to form the Meissner tetrahedron, which does. Alternatively, the surface of revolution of the Reuleaux triangle also has constant width."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Reuleaux triangle", "description": "A shape formed from the intersection

It runs from Bank Street in the south to Industrial Avenue in the north covering the neighbourhoods of Ridgemont, Alta Vista and Riverview.\n\nAlta Vista was created as the result of major residential developments (notably the Rideau Park and Alta Vista subdivisions) in the region following World War II. First referred to as the \"100 foot highway\", was renamed Churchill Avenue (after Winston Churchill) in 1941. It became \"Alta Vista Drive\" in July 1950 as the result of Ottawa annexing that part of Gloucester Township (there was already a Churchill Avenue in Ottawa). The first stretch was built between Smyth Road and Kilborn Avenue in 1939. Gloucester Township Council passed a by-law on May 3, 1937 permitting its construction. The stretch from Kilborn to Randall was built in 1940; the stretch north of Smyth in 1942 (to what is now Terminal Avenue) and south of Randall to Bank Street (then called \"Metcalfe Road\") in 1947.\n\nAlta Vista originally ran past Industrial and connected with the Vanier Parkway, but the intersection, which also involved Riverside Drive was re-aligned in 1986. Furthermore, in the 1990s, Alta Vista gained bicycle lanes along its entire stretch. Alta Vista is so named for its general height, as the neighbourhoods it runs through are generally higher than the rest of the city (the name means \"a view from above\" or \"high view\" in Spanish and Portuguese). The name was first applied to the area in 1913, for a small subdivision built on the north side of Randall Avenue which had a good view of Parliament Hill.\n\nFor the most part, Alta Vista runs through residential areas, and it is a two to four-lane minor arterial road, with a speed limit of . The area consists mostly of single-home houses, with the exception of three apartment-style, low-rent buildings named the \"Alta Vista Towers\" located in the north near Industrial Avenue and the Alta Vista Plaza. Alta Vista Drive consists of mixed housing, ranging from small modest houses in the northern parts, to more expensive, small Colonial-style houses and bungalows in the area immediately south to Smyth Road.\n\nThe road is characterized by large trees along both sides and the Via Rail train track running parallel between Alta Vista Drive and Riverside Drive from Industrial Avenue to Smyth Road.\n\nAlta Vista is home to the National Defence Medical Centre, Canadian Pharmacists Association, Canadian Blood Services, Canadian Dental Association, Ontario Medical Association, the Canadian Medical Association, and its affiliate MD Management, and the Conference Board of Canada, located in the area north of the Smyth Road intersection in a stretch of the road that is not residential, as well as Ridgemont High School and St. Patrick's High School located south from Smyth Road. The area is home to the Anglican Church St. Thomas the Apostle, the United Church Rideau Park, and the Presbyterian Church St. Timothy's. There is one branch of the Ottawa Library and two shopping centres, one being at the northernmost stretch near Industrial Avenue, and the other at the southernmost section abutting Bank Street."},

system administrators, software developers, and other technical users of the Apple Macintosh line of computers.\n\nThe magazine was called \"MacTech\" for its first two issues, starting in 1984, after which its name was changed to MacTutor. At the time the magazine defined itself as \"a technical publication devoted to advancing programming knowledge of the Macintosh for both hacker and professional alike\". \n\nIn the spring of 1989 a new and separate magazine called MacTech was launched by TechAlliance, a global Apple users group headquartered in Renton, WA that hosted the Apple Programmers and Developers Association (APDA). The founding editor of MacTech was Andrew Himes, and Himes described the magazine as \"The journal designed by people who program and develop for the Apple Macintosh. You hold in your hands what is designed to be a legendary publication for a legendary computer. In these wee, early hours of the computer revolution, just a scant half decade after the introduction of Apple's flagship computer, the world needs a magazine that focuses on the needs of the Mac developer community with the intensity, vision, and utility of no other existing publication. Nuts-and-bolts programming solutions and tutorials. In-depth looks at future technologies and present opportunities. An emphasis on both object-oriented and proceduarl languages, on database programming and spreadsheet macros, on HyperTalking and multimedia applications. Feature articles, tutorials, reviews, and commentary by some of the most important, creative, and eloquent programmers in the Macintosh universe. MacTech will be preeminently useful and intellectually provocative. An essential desktop reference for today's serious programmers, as well as a tool that will help pave your way to the future of programming.\" \n\nIn 1993, \"MacTutor Magazine\" purchased \"MacTech\", and the name of the consolidated publication became MacTech.\n\nIn 2010, \"MacTech\" launched its event series -- first with MacTech Conference, then MacTech Boot Camp and then MacTech InDepth. 2010 had a single event, 2011 had seven events, and 2012 has fifteen events.\n\nMacTech.com also provides a news aggregator service.\n\nThe magazine is privately owned, held by Xplain Corporation.\n\nOn June 5, 2008, MacTech announced it would act as caretaker to the archives of MacMinute News and Forums. At these forums, Stan's Lounge is crowded with MacMinute and MacCentral faithful in honor of Stan Flack's contributions to the Macintosh community.\n\nOn November 6, 2009, MacTech announced that it was acquiring MacMod, a community site dedicated to modding Apple hardware and software. As part of the acquisition, the MacMod forums have been integrated into MacTech's, and MacTech now has a podcast dedicated to Mac technical topics as well as industry news, event coverage, and interviews."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "MacTech", "description": "A monthly magazine for technical users of Apple Macintosh computers.", "types": ["Magazine", "Technology", "Apple"]}, {"label":

He began playing hard rock guitar at age 13, but gravitated into classical after finding an ad for classical guitar lessons in a school trash can. Frasca originally entered the University of Arizona with the intent of studying classical guitar, but realized after a year that it wasn't his style. Leaving the University of Arizona after his scholarship for classical guitar was canceled, he enrolled in colleges in Ohio, also trying Yale University, where he first met composer Marc Mellits. The friendship and collaboration did not begin until Mellits and Frasca met once more, through a mutual friend at Cornell University.\n\nSeeking to perfect his art, Frasca had an extensive practice routine, often spending up to 14 hours a day playing. While it initially added to his abilities, the rigorousness took its toll; Frasca developed focal dystonia\u2014the loss of motor control in his fingers. He spent two years seeking treatment for the condition, unable to play at all. Frasca turned to weight training as a source of help. By keeping a balance between his practice and working out, he regained full use of his hands in 2003.\n\nHe is probably best known for his customized ten-string guitar, which allows him to create a unique, layered sound normally only accomplishable using multiple instruments or post-recording techniques such as overdubbing.\n\nFrasca's technique incorporates classical guitar technique in the right hand as well as rock techniques such as tapping, hammer-ons, and pull-offs in the left hand. But Frasca has also expanded beyond these traditional techniques by inventing and creating other techniques to meet specific needs or problems presented by a specific composition. These include the use of a prepared guitar, with single string \"mini-capos\", the addition of pads on the body of the guitar (which Frasca uses for a myriad of percussion sounds and timbres), and attached sticks and levers on the body of the guitar, used to create percussive sounds. \"All my inspiration comes from ensembles,\" Frasca says. \"Most notably The Philip Glass Ensemble, Steve Reich and Musicians, Anthony Davis and Episteme, The Who, The \u00c1stor Piazzolla Quintet, and Led Zeppelin to name a few.\" \"It always bothered me that when I would go to a classical guitar concert I would often leave knowing nothing about the person I just spent two hours listening to. I want people to know who I am and I want to know who my audience is- the most fundamental way that people communicate is by discovery.\"\n\nFrasca has been called \"Eddie Van Halen for eggheads\" by \"Entertainment Weekly\". He is currently signed with Canataloupe Music and has released two albums, entitled \"Deviations\", and \"Forced Entry\".\n\nIn 2005, Frasca opened a small, high-tech, surround-sound nightclub in New York City named \"The Monkey\", which he has described as \"a space that is all about the music, the sound and the visuals, not about selling drinks.\" The performance space is on the 12th floor of a building."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Dominic Frasca", "description": "A guitarist known for his unique sound and customized ten-string guitar.", "types": ["Musician", "Guitarist",

Generally similar to the Castle class naval trawlers of 1916-18, though somewhat larger, they were mainly used on minesweeping and harbour defence duties. Most were armed with one 12-pounder gun (76mm) and three or four 20 mm Oerlikon AA guns with 30 depth charges. In the Dance class a 4-inch AA gun (102\u00a0mm) was fitted in place of the 12-pdr, and there were six 20\u00a0mm Oerlikons in \"Annet\", \"Bressay\", \"Damsay\", \"Fiaray\", \"Foulness\" and \"Lindisfarne\". Four of the trawlers were given 'Bird' names when converted to controlled minelayers in 1943-44: \"Blackbird\" (M15), \"Dabchick\" (M22), \"Stonechat\" (M25) and \"Whitethroat\" (M03). A total of 23 of these trawlers were lost during the war. Six trawlers were loaned to Canada in 1942-45 and five to Norway in 1943-45.\n\nPostwar, 17 of the trawlers were disarmed as wreck disposal vessels: \"Bardsey\" (DV13), \"Bern\" (DV4), \"Caldy\" (DV5) \"Coll\" (DV6), \"Earraid\" (DV7), \"Fetlar\" (DV8), \"Flatholm\" (DV9), \"Graemsay\" (DV10), \"Lindisfarne\" (DV11), \"Lundy\" (DV12), \"Neave\" (DV14), \"Scalpay\" (DV15), \"Skomer\" (DV16), \"Steepholm\" (DV17), \"Switha\" (DV18), \"Tiree\" (DV19), and \"Trondra\" (DV20). At least five were employed as danlayers (laying and retrieving dan buoys during minesweeping operations): \"Imersay\" (J422), \"Sandray\" (J424), \"Shillay\" (J426), \"Sursay\" (J427) and \"Tocogay\" (J451). After decommissioning, \"Switha\" and \"Coll\" were converted to oil tank cleaning vessels for dockyard service in 1949-50.\n\nBy 1949 there remained in service of this type 31 trawlers and four controlled minelayers in the Royal Navy, one controlled minelayer in the Royal Canadian Navy, and four trawlers in the Royal New Zealand Navy. An additional 16 were in service in the Italian Navy and six in the Portuguese Navy. Most of the surviving Royal Navy examples were discarded in the 1950s, but a few remained until the 1960s. Two acquired postwar by the Federal German Navy remained in service as training vessels well into the 1970s, with one, \"Trave\" (ex-\"Dochet\"), resold to Turkey for further service in 1977."},

In the first election held after the end of World War I and the first election after the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, Republican Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio defeated Democratic Governor James M. Cox of Ohio.\n\nIncumbent Democratic President Woodrow Wilson privately hoped for a third term, but party leaders were unwilling to re-nominate the ailing and unpopular incumbent. Former President Theodore Roosevelt had been the front-runner for the Republican nomination, but he died in 1919 without leaving an obvious heir to his progressive legacy. With both Wilson and Roosevelt out of the running, the major parties turned to little-known dark horse candidates from the state of Ohio, a swing state with a large number of electoral votes. Cox won the 1920 Democratic National Convention on the 44th ballot, defeating William Gibbs McAdoo (Wilson's son-in-law), A. Mitchell Palmer, and several other candidates. Harding emerged as a compromise candidate between the conservative and progressive wings of the party, and he clinched his nomination on the tenth ballot of the 1920 Republican National Convention.\n\nThe election was dominated by the American social and political environment in the aftermath of World War I, which was marked by a hostile response to certain aspects of Wilson's foreign policy and a massive reaction against the reformist zeal of the Progressive Era. The wartime economic boom had collapsed and the country was deep in a recession. Wilson's advocacy for America's entry into the League of Nations in the face of a return to non-interventionist opinion challenged his effectiveness as president, and overseas there were wars and revolutions. At home, the year 1919 was marked by major strikes in the meatpacking and steel industries and large-scale race riots in Chicago and other cities. Anarchist attacks on Wall Street produced fears of radicals and terrorists. The Irish Catholic and German communities were outraged at Wilson's perceived favoritism of their traditional enemy Great Britain, and his political position was critically weakened after he suffered a stroke in 1919 that left him severely disabled.\n\nHarding all but ignored Cox in the race and essentially campaigned against Wilson by calling for a \"return to normalcy\". Harding won a landslide victory, sweeping every state outside of the South and becoming the first Republican since the end of Reconstruction to win a former state of the Confederacy, Tennessee. Harding's victory margin of 26.2% in the popular vote remains the largest popular-vote percentage margin in presidential elections since the unopposed re-election of James Monroe in 1820, though other candidates have since exceeded his share of the popular vote. Cox won just 34.1% of the popular vote, and Socialist Eugene V. Debs won 3.4%, despite being in prison at the time. It was also the first election in which women had the right to vote in all 48 states, which caused the total popular vote to increase dramatically, from 18.5 million in 1916 to 26.8 million in 1920. Both vice presidential nominees would eventually become president in their own right: Harding would pass away in 1923 and be succeeded by Vice President Calvin Coolidge, while the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Franklin D. Roosevelt, would eventually win an unprecedented four consecutive presidential elections starting in 1932."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "1920 United States presidential election", "description": "A quadrennial election in which Republican Senator Warren G.

To be successful, the skydiver must catch the parachute, secure it, and glide to the projected landing zone. There is no known, credible evidence that a banzai skydive has ever really occurred according to its definition.\n\nThere have however been multiple recorded instances of skydivers jumping without being attached to a parachute. However these jumps lack the element that make them a banzai skydive, where a parachute is thrown out of the plane then caught by the jumper after some delay. During skydives where the jumper is detached from the skydiving rig the rig is held by the skydiver or an assistant until the skydiver is secured to the rig. This is due to the skydiving rig having a much slower terminal velocity than a skydiver is capable of achieving. This has led the skydiving community to doubt the idea that banzai skydiving has ever occurred as defined.\n\nSkydivers jumping while detached from a rig wear a special harness that attaches to a cord extending from the parachute. The cord can be clearly seen in Andreas Dachtler's jump video taken in Southeast Europe. This ensures the skydiver can safely recover the parachute. Otherwise, the legstraps on a normal harness would require a thread through. This would be impossible while in free fall.\n\nThe banzai skydive is the most dangerous category in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\", according to Editor Craig Glenday. Yasuhiro Kubo took the challenge on September 2, 2000. Kubo supposedly fell alongside the rig for 50 seconds after jumping before regaining and deploying his parachute. Details about the jump are sparse and it is unknown whether Kubo or another skydiver held onto the rig while falling. This won him a place in the Guinness World Records. This claim however was not witnessed by a Guinness Book of World Records official, but was witnessed by an unknown expert. No video or photographic evidence exists to support the claim.\n\nThe Banzai skydiving category is still accepted in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\". Guinness cannot accept a record claim that is likely to put people at risk other than the person attempting the world record. As long as the Banzai skydive guidelines are followed, nobody is at risk. The guidelines state that the jump must be done away from public places."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Banzai skydiving", "description": "A rumored form of skydiving where the skydiver throws their parachute out of the airplane door, waits, and then jumps after it, catching and securing it before gliding to the landing zone", "types": ["Extreme sports", "Skydiving"]}, {"label": "Parachute", "description": "A device used to slow the motion of an object through an atmosphere by creating drag", "types": ["Aerospace technology", "Safety equipment"]}, {"label": "Skydiver", "description": "A person who jumps from an aircraft and performs acrobatic maneuvers during freefall before landing by parachute", "types": ["Extreme sports", "Aviation"]}, {"label": "Landing zone", "description": "The designated area where a skydiver aims to land and safely touch down after a jump", "types": ["Aviation", "Safety"]}, {"label": "Skydiving rig", "description": "The equipment worn by a skydiver that includes a harness, container, and parachute", "types": ["Aviation", "Safety equipment"]}, {"label": "Terminal velocity", "description": "The constant speed that a freely falling object eventually reaches when the resistance of the medium through which it is falling prevents further acceleration", "types": ["Physics", "Mechanics"]}, {"label": "Harness", "description": "A set of straps and fittings by which a person is fastened to a parachute during a jump", "types": ["Safety equipment", "Extreme sports"]}, {"label": "Guinness Book of World Records", "description": "A reference book published annually that lists world records and achievements", "types": ["Reference books", "Achievements"]}], "gold": [{"uri": "Q193210", "boundaries": [38, 47], "surfaceform": "skydiving", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q482816", "boundaries": [83, 92], "surfaceform": "parachute", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q3305194", "boundaries": [243, 255], "surfaceform": "landing zone", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q333518", "boundaries": [1080, 1087], "surfaceform": "harness", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "None", "boundaries": [1174, 1190], "surfaceform": "Andreas Dachtler", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q263686", "boundaries": [1213, 1229], "surfaceform": "Southeast Europe", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q140028", "boundaries": [1402, 1411], "surfaceform": "free fall", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q41675", "boundaries": [1472, 1502], "surfaceform": "Guinness Book of World Records", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q41675", "boundaries": [1525, 1538], "surfaceform": "Craig Glenday", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "None", "boundaries": [1540, 1553], "surfaceform": "Yasuhiro Kubo", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q41675", "boundaries": [1855, 1877], "surfaceform": "Guinness World Records", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q4857391", "boundaries": [0, 16], "surfaceform": "Banzai skydiving", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q4857391", "boundaries": [2070, 2086], "surfaceform": "Banzai skydiving", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "2000-09-02T00:00:00Z^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime", "boundaries": [1576, 1593], "surfaceform": "September 2, 2000", "annotator": "Date_Linker"}, {"uri": "+50^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [1638, 1640], "surfaceform": "50", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}]}, "triples": {"gpt": [{"subject label": "Banzai skydiving", "predicate label": "involves", "predicate description": "expresses a relationship between two entities where one entity (the subject) is connected to the other entity (the object) in a way that the object is a necessary component or element of the subject.", "object label": "Parachute"}, {"subject label": "Banzai skydiving", "predicate label": "performed by", "predicate description": "expresses a relationship between two entities where one entity (the subject) is the agent or performer of an action or activity that involves the other entity (the object).", "object label": "Skydiver"}, {"subject label": "Banzai skydiving", "predicate label": "ends in", "predicate description": "expresses a relationship between two entities where one entity (the subject) is the starting point of an action or activity that leads to the other entity (the object) as its final destination or outcome.", "object label": "Landing zone"}, {"subject label": "Skydiver", "predicate label": "lands by", "predicate description": "Expresses the means by which the subject reaches the ground after jumping from an aircraft.

This met during a disturbed period in Scotland's history. The Church, in particular, was trying to establish its independence of King James VI and the civil courts. The highlight of the meeting was when they defied a deputation of Lords of Session. They wished to try the case of the Minister of Stirling whose reputation had been called into question in a civil case. A man charged with forgery had confessed to the Minister, but now wished to say the Minister had misused his position to get him to do so. The case was before the Court of Session and it, the King and the Lords of Session did not want the Assembly to interfere. The Assembly was not intimidated and proceeded to examine - and clear - the minister. Nicol Dalgleish presided over these debates.\n\nNicol was born about 1560. His brother was a merchant in Inverness so he may have originated in, or had connections with that city. He is mentioned as having been a Regent (or \"teacher\") in St Leonard's College in the University of St Andrews, so he most likely studied there. In 1582 he is mentioned as being a Minister in the \"Collegiate Charge\" of St Cuthbert's Church in Edinburgh. In 1582 he was tried for his life, accused of supporting rebel clergy who had fled from the King. He was acquitted, was tried again. This time it was for corresponding with the rebels - one (partisan) source says that he had merely looked at a letter one of the rebels had written home to his wife. He was sentenced to death, but this was not carried out. It was reported that the scaffold that had been prepared for him was left standing outside his home for several weeks.\n\nHe was appointed Chaplain to the Earl of Angus in the early summer of 1586, and left St Cuthbert\u2019s in October of that year. Unfortunately, the Earl died two years later (in 1588) and Nicol had to find another living. He was licensed by the Assembly to find himself some other parish, as \"\"he could not continue for lack of provisioun, 12 July 1586, and had ane testimoniall from the haill parochin\"\n\nIn fact, his St Andrews contacts may have helped. James Melville was the nephew of Andrew Melville, both connected to St Andrews University. James Melville as Principal of the University controlled a number of appointments to parishes, among them one to a post that involved four separate churches - Kilrenny, Anstruther, Pittenweem and Abercrombie. He wanted to establish them as separate parishes with good, reliable (protestant) ministers. He offered Nicol Dalgleish the Pittenweem post, along with an old priory, which had also once belonged to the University"}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Nicol Dalgleish", "description": "Moderator

"Q5344215", "title": "Edward Lovett", "text": "Edward Lovett (July 1852 \u2013 1933) was an English folklorist, recognised for his collections of charms, amulets, and objects used in children's games.\n\nHe was born in Islington and lived in Outram Road, Croydon, later residing in Caterham, and is reported to have worked as a chief cashier at branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland in the City of London. Lovett spent his spare time collecting, writing, and lecturing on folk-lore, usually focused on objects he had collected on his walks around London, Sussex and Surrey. \n\nLovett was married and had at least two children. His oldest son served in the First World War. \n\nAfter his retirement in 1912, he dedicated himself full time to this endeavor, and to sharing his love of alpine plants. An early work, self-published, is \"How to Make A Rock Garden and Grow Alpine Plants\", not dated, but presumably around 1900. The two interests overlapped when Lovett was able to exchange small alpine specimens, grown in seashells, for amulets and charms from the people he met in London. \n\nHe also reports having made collections in Belgium and Holland. Lovett's exhibitions in England and Wales were reviewed in the national press, some becoming permanent exhibits, and donated many objects to the Pitt Rivers Museum between 1896 and 1911. He lectured at many schools, colleges, special interest groups and societies, and reached a wide public through regular articles in local papers, describing contemporary superstitions and beliefs.\n\nAn article in the Museum's Journal in 1906 set out Lovett's vision for a folk museum of Britain, and he continued to collect and campaign with this aim in mind, until the early 1920s.\n\nIn 1914, Edward Lovett displayed over 500 dolls at the National Museum of Wales, with the intention of entertaining children and presenting to adults a \"scientific history of the doll, from the standpoints of ethnography and folklore\". Lovett's interest in dolls as idols, or miniature representations, led him to the theory that the dolls in coffins found on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh in the 1830s were substitution burials for sailors lost at sea. This theory has not been supported by recent scholarship.\n\nOver his long career collecting folklore, Lovett corresponded with many museum curators and collectors, including Henry Wellcome. The exhibition 'Folklore of London', curated by Lovett, was held at the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum in 1916.\n\nDuring the late 1880s he served as President of the Croydon Microscopical and Natural History Club. After joining the Folklore Society in 1900, he presented it with talks and published papers in its \"Journal\". Lovett did not venture into theorising on folklore, confining his research to the collection of talismans and other objects with superstitious claims. A major work, \"Magic in Modern London\", was published in 1925. \n\nEdward Lovett's donations can be found in many museums, including the Cuming Museum in Southwark, the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford, the V&A Museum of Childhood, and the Museum of Childhood in Edinburgh (on long term loan from the National Museum of Wales).\n\nAn exhibition \"Charmed Life: The solace of objects\" held at the Wellcome Collection from 6 October 2011 to 26 February 2012, displayed many of Lovett's amulets alongside contemporary films and medals by artist and curator Felicity Powell."},

During this time he studied theology and was licensed to preach the gospel.\n\nIn the year 1822, he was ordained as pastor of the Congregational Church in Watertown, Connecticut, where he remained about two years, being then compelled to resign his pastorate on account of ill-health. In 1824 he returned to Hartford and became editor of the \"Connecticut Observer\", a religious newspaper, which he conducted with ability for many years. He also held the office of Secretary of the Missionary Society of Connecticut, from 1826, and of the Connecticut Home Missionary Society, from 1831 till his death.\n\nIn 1852, he was appointed Chaplain of the Retreat for the Insane, performing the duties of that office until incapacitated by an attack of paralysis in August, 1862. For several years previous to 1855, he spent his leisure time in the preparation of books for children. Among these were \"Child's Book on the Sabbath\", \"The Farmer\", \"Prophets and Prophecy\", and four volumes of \"Scripture Biography\". In connection with Rev. Dr. Gallaudet, he prepared \"The Practical Spelling Book,\" and \"The School and Family Dictionary.\" With the assistance of Rev. Dr. Daggett, he selected and arranged the \"Hymns and Psalms,\" as set forth by the General Association of Connecticut, in use for twenty years past in most of the Congregational Churches in this State. Mr. Hooker was a clear thinker, and expressed his thoughtfulness in a style remarkable for its neatness and perspicuity.\n\nHe married, July 17, 1822, Mary Ann Brown, who died May 3, 1838, without children. He married Harriet Watkinson, Nov 22, 1843, who survived him. He died in Hartford, December 17, 1864, aged 71 years. He left a son, Thomas, and a daughter."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Horace Hooker", "description": "American Congregationalist minister and author", "types": ["Person", "Author", "Minister"]}, {"label": "Elijah Hooker", "description": "Father of Horace Hooker", "types": ["Person"]}, {"label": "Susanna Seymour Hooker", "description": "Mother of Horace Hooker", "types": ["Person"]}, {"label": "Rev.

Belonging to the Hanbali school of orthodox Sunni jurisprudence, of which he is regarded as \"one of the most important thinkers,\" Ibn al-Qayyim is today best remembered as the foremost disciple and student of the controversial fourteenth-century Sunni theologian Ibn Taymiyyah, with whom he was imprisoned in 1326 for dissenting against established tradition during Ibn Taymiyyah's famous incarceration in the Citadel of Damascus.\n\nOf humble origin, Ibn al-Qayyim's father was the principal (\"qayyim\") of the School of Jawziyya, which also served as a court of law for the Hanbali judge of Damascus during the time period. Ibn al-Qayyim went on to become a prolific scholar, producing a rich corpus of \"doctrinal and literary\" works. As a result, numerous important Muslim scholars of the Mamluk period were among Ibn al-Qayyim's students or, at least, greatly influenced by him, including, amongst others, the Shafi historian Ibn Kathir (d. 774/1373), the Hanbali hadith scholar Ibn Rajab (d. 795/1397), and the Shafi polymath Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d. 852/1449). In the present day, Ibn al-Qayyim's name has become a controversial one in certain quarters of the Islamic world due to his popularity amongst many adherents of the Sunni movements of Salafism and Wahhabism, who see in his criticisms of such widespread orthodox Sunni practices of the medieval period as the veneration of saints and the veneration of their graves and relics a classical precursor to their own perspective."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Shams al-D\u012bn Ab\u016b \u02bfAbd All\u0101h Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Ab\u012b Bakr ibn Ayy\u016bb al-Zur\u02bf\u012b l-Dimashq\u012b

O'Hara [\u05f4Jenny\u05f4] (November 30, 1918 \u2013 March 7, 2001) was a pitcher and utility who played from through in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at , 122\u00a0lb., she batted and threw right-handed.\n\nJanice O'Hara was one of the sixty original players to join the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League for its inaugural season. A valuable and versatile player, she had an array of pitches that kept the hitters guessing, and also played several positions competently during her seven years in the league.\n\nBorn in Beardstown, Illinois, O'Hara started playing organized softball in Springfield in her teen years, until AAGPBL scout Eddie Stumpf interviewed her and sent her to the final tryout at Wrigley Field in Chicago. In the process, she was signed a contract and joined the Kenosha Comets, playing for them her entire career in the league.\n\nComets manager Josh Billings used O'Hara at first base and she hit a respectable .187 average and posted career-numbers in hits (63), triples (6), runs (46) and RBI (28), helping Kenosha win the second half of the 1943 season. The team faced first-half winner Racine Belles in the best-of-five series and was shut out in three games.\n\nBy 1944, new manager Marty McManus turned O'Hara into a utility player. She collected a personal-high 37 stolen bases and belted the only home run of her career in that season. After that, she mostly played at first base and in the outfield, but also filled at second base and third base through the 1946 season.\n\nIn 1947 O'Hara was converted into a pitcher by then manager Ralph Shinners. In her repertoire she included a fastball, a curve and specially a knuckleball, which she loved to use. She turned in a 6\u20138 record with a 3.51 earned run average in 21 appearances. The next year she went 4\u20136 in 20 games while lowering her ERA to 3.20. Used sparingly in 1949, she had a 2\u20133 mark and a 4.65 ERA in 11 games.\n\nIn a seven-year career, O'Hara posted a 13\u201317 record and a 3.56 ERA in 55 games. As a hitter, she batted a .199 average in 309 games. In three postseason appearances, she batted .130 (3-for-23) in seven games and hurled six innings of shutout ball for a perfect 0.00 ERA.\n\nFollowing her baseball career, O'Hara worked as an accountant for 31 years and retired in 1982. She later spent her time in the garden and attended AAGPBL Players Association reunions. The association was largely responsible for the opening of \"Women in Baseball\", a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.\n\nJanice O'Hara died in 2001 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the age of 82."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Janice Winifred O'Hara

It was later identified as a grade compose of various basal euchelicerates, eventually excluded form the monophyletic Xiphosura \"sensu stricto\" and only regarded as horseshoe crabs under a broader sense ('Xiphosura' \"sensu lato\"). Synziphosurines survived at least since early Ordovician to early Carboniferous in ages, with most species are known from the in-between Silurian strata.\nThe body of synziphosurine composed of a prosoma covered by a dome-like carapace (prosomal dorsal shield) and an opisthosoma with usually unfused 9-11 segments expressed by tergites. With the exception of \"Pseudoniscus\" and \"Pasternakevia\", the last 3 opisthosomal segments precede the spine-like telson are specialized into a narrow postabdomen (pretelson), while the remaining wider segments referred to as preabdomen. A reduced anteriormost tergite (microtergite) originated from the first opisthosomal segment is observable at least in some genera. Most synziphosurines are possibly blind, with only a few species showing possible (e.g. \"Weinbergina opitzi\") or clear (e.g. \"Legrandella lombardii\") evidences of lateral compound eyes on their carapaces. Evidences of appendages are scarce, fragmentary known from \"Anderella parva\", \"Camanchia grovensis\" and \"Venustulus waukeshaensis\" while exceptionally well-documented in \"Weinbergina opitzi\". The prosoma possess a pair of chelicerae and at least 5 pairs of walking legs while the opisthosoma probably has 6 pairs of plate-like opercula. While \"Weinbergina\" and \"Willwerathia\" being exceptionally large, most synziphosurines are small arthropods with body length ranging only about a few centimeters long.\n\nAs of 2020, at least 13 genera and 20 species were considered to be synziphosurines. The even basal euchelicerates \"Offacolus\" and \"Dibasterium\", the questionable genus \"Borchgrevinkium\", as well as the Dekatriata-related \"Houia\" and \"Winneshiekia\", may also regarded as

During 1858, they moved to Jack County, Texas and settled on Boone's Creek, in the southwestern part of the county.\n\nOn October 26, 1863, during the early afternoon, J. H. Tackitt, a son of Mann Tackitt, went out in a southwesterly direction in search of stock. Shortly afterwards, his father, who was armed with a double-barrel gun, went north for the same purpose. Tackitt's gun was loaded with a ball on one side, and a buck shot on the other. He was also armed with a pistol. When he had gone only about one mile from his home, he found himself surrounded by fifteen or twenty savage Indians. At first he made an attempt, to run home. But since his best horses had been stolen by the Indians, the Indians soon overtook him. Tackitt then dismounted to sell his life as dearly as possible, at a point within one-half mile of his own residence. He fought the warriors away for some time, as was shown by the circular trail some distance from the tree, behind which Tackitt, perhaps, held the Indians at bay until he discharged all of his loads, for seven or eight shots were heard at the residence.\n\nWhen J.H. Tackett reached home, he was informed of the firing, and heard some of the shots himself. As a consequence, he and a younger brother, Caleb, went out in search of their father, and it seems that Caleb, previous to this, had made an attempt to offer his father some assistance, but realized that it was of no avail, for the Indians were still on the ground. \n\nIn a short time, J.H. and Caleb Tackett reached their father, who was already dead, stripped of a part of his clothing, but not scalped. His guns were gone, and many arrows were in the tree by which he stood, on the ground, and in his body. The boys hurried to the ranch for a wagon, notified the neighbors and arranged for a coffin to be made at Veal's Station where he was buried.\n\nA posse of citizens followed the Indian trail, and after going for, perhaps, half a mile, they found a dead savage, and indications disclosed others were wounded. The dead Indian was dragged to the Tackett ranch and stood against a tree some distance from the residence.\n\nMany years after the death of Mann Tackitt, the metal part of his old double barrel gun was found a short distance from where the fight occurred."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Mann Darius Tackitt", "description": "A man who lived in Texas in the mid-1800s", "types": ["Person", "Historical Figure"]}, {"label": "Pleasant Tackitt", "description": "The brother of Mann Darius Tackitt", "types": ["Person", "Historical Figure"]}, {"label": "Parker County", "description": "A county in Texas where Mann Darius Tackitt and Pleasant Tackitt lived", "types": ["Place", "Geographic Area"]}, {"label": "Weatherford, Texas", "description": "A city in Texas located near where Mann Darius Tackitt and Pleasant Tackitt lived", "types": ["Place", "Geographic Area"]}, {"label": "Jack County", "description": "A county in Texas where Mann Darius Tackitt and Pleasant Tackitt later settled", "types": ["Place", "Geographic Area"]}, {"label": "Boone's Creek", "description": "A creek in southwestern Jack County, Texas where Mann Darius Tackitt and Pleasant Tackitt settled", "types": ["Place", "Geographic Area"]}, {"label": "J.

Announced on March 5, 2015, \"Rock Band 4\" refocuses on the core gameplay of the franchise, reducing the emphasis on musical instruction that was employed by its predecessor, \"Rock Band 3\", while emphasizing the game's social interactions, as well as new features enabling players to incorporate improvisation into their performance\u2014such as \"freestyle solos\" on guitar, and \"freeform melodies\" on multi-part vocals.\n\n\"Rock Band 4\" offers backward compatibility with content and hardware from previous versions of \"Rock Band\" within the same console family; wireless guitar and drum controllers from PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of \"Rock Band\" can be used on the PS4 and Xbox One versions (with PS4 using an existing USB dongle, and Xbox One requiring a newly produced USB dongle), and DLC songs purchased on prior installments on PS3 and Xbox 360 can be re-downloaded at no extra charge on PS4 and Xbox One in a ported form that supports the game's features. Harmonix plans to release free and paid DLC that will add new features and content to the game over time, in lieu of releasing yearly installments; this includes the addition of support for synchronous online play added on January 25, 2017.\n\nCritical reception to \"Rock Band 4\" on-launch was positive, with reviews praising the game for not significantly deviating from the gameplay mechanics of prior installments, as well as the higher degree of creative freedom offered by the Freestyle Solos feature, and its backward compatibility with previously-released content for the \"Rock Band\" franchise. The game was also criticized for lacking features present in previous versions, such as online multiplayer and practice modes."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Rock Band 4", "description": "A music

It has been the flagship station of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers since 2004. Licensed to Gulfport, Florida, the station's studios are located in South Tampa and the transmitter site is in Riverview. WFUS is one of the eight stations in the Tampa Bay market owned by iHeartMedia.\n\nThe station formerly went by \"Thunder 103.5\" as a classic rock station that started on March 14, 1995 on 105.5 FM. Ron Diaz worked as the morning drive host at that time. On April 5, 1999, WTBT swapped frequencies with then-sister station WDUV, moving to 103.5 FM. Towards the end of the station's days, it was the Tampa affiliate for The Bob and Tom Show. On April 13, 2005, WTBT flipped to its current country format as WFUS, \"US 103.5\", leaving Cox Radio's WHPT as the market's only classic rock station at that time. iHeartMedia (then known as Clear Channel Communications) later relaunched the classic rock format as \"Thunder Across The Bay\", operating on FM translators at 94.5 FM (Gulfport), 99.1 FM (Holiday), 105.9 FM (Tampa), and on WMTX-HD2.\n\nIn August 2014, its HD2 subchannel's format changed to Soft EZ Oldies, a format meant to compete with market leader WDUV. Prior to that, the HD2 subchannel was classic rock, branded as \"Thunder 103.5 HD2\".\n\nIn September 2014, WFUS-HD2 flipped once again, as Alternative/New Rock formatted \"ALT 99-9\", meant to compete with Cox Radio's WSUN. \"ALT\" was also broadcast on FM translator W207BU at 99.9\u00a0MHz, located in Bayonet Point. On November 7, 2014, at Noon, W207BU moved from 99.9\u00a0MHz to 100.3\u00a0MHz to eliminate interference with WXJB in Brooksville. The station then re-branded as \"ALT 100.3\". The translator also changed call letters, and is now identifying as W262CP. On March 14, 2016, the \"ALT\" format was replaced with a rebroadcast of iHeart's Sarasota-based Tropical/Latin pop-formatted WRUB (FM) \"Rumba 106.5\".\n\nWFUS was the official flagship station of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2004\u20132016.

It was an outgrowth of the Wesson Rifle Company.\n\nChristian Sharps, who later founded the Sharps Rifle Company, transferred the manufacture of his first rifle to the company in 1849 or 1850.\n\nThe company also manufactured Wesson & Leavitt revolvers between 1850 and 1851. These were said to be the first revolvers patented after Colt's.\n\nIn 1851, Samuel Colt filed and won a historic patent infringement lawsuit against the Massachusetts Arms Company. The company then limited its revolver production to relatively unpopular designs by Edward Maynard until 1857, when Colt's patent expired.\n\nMaynard patented his revolutionary breechloading rifle in 1851. It was actually manufactured by Massachusetts Arms, which had been using Maynard's system under contract for several years. In 1855 they produced 2,000 Greene Carbines, a Maynard system firearm, for a British government contract. These carbines were NOT used in the Crimean War.\n\nMaynard's rifle was operated by a lever which when depressed raised the barrel to open the breech for loading. A brass cartridge, also developed by Maynard, was then inserted and the lever raised to close the breech. Once cocked the loaded rifle could then be primed by either placing a percussion cap directly on its nipple or by using Maynard's patented priming system to advance a primer to the nipple.\n\nAlso in 1857 the company received a contract to manufacture Adams revolvers under license for the U.S. government. Some 500 or so were produced and used in the U.S. Civil War.\n\nThe company also produced single- and double-barrel shotguns, including both box-locks and external central hammers. Later it manufactured a selection of 20- and 28-bore Maynard-action shotguns of 1865 and 1873 patterns.\n\nWith civil war looming some Southern states purchased Maynard rifles from the company for their state militias. Of close to 3000 sales, most were to Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. The First Model Maynard was designated an official Confederate firearm.\n\nThe factory burned down in January 1861, halting production until the factory was rebuilt in 1863. The company then received an order for 20,000 of the simpler Second Model Maynard carbines. Deliveries of these guns began in June 1864 continuing through May 1865. As the war was then coming to an end few saw service. Some, however, are known to have been used by the 9th and 11th Indiana Cavalry and the 11th Tennessee Cavalry regiments.\n\nIn 1893 the company was purchased by the J Stevens Arms & Tool Company, also founded by Joshua Stevens. Stevens had left the Massachusetts Arms Company in 1864. The purchase was made to protect the interests of Edward Maynard's widow and provide security for the company's workers.\n\nIn the late 19th century the company began producing revolvers on various Smith & Wesson patterns.\n\nProduction continued until the factory closed permanently during the Great Depression.\n\nThe Massachusetts Arms Company name was retained by Stevens and later used as a trade name for firearms produced for sale at the Blish, Mize and Silliman Hardware Company of Atchison, Kansas."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Massachusetts Arms Company", "description": "A

It was built by BHP in 1943, as a Technical school for BHP\u2019s apprentices to be educated in. The school catered for year 8 to year 12. There were 113 students who were originally enrolled at the school. In 1965-1966 temporary buildings (portables) were put up to hold the extra students, in 1966 there was 1,284 students at Whyalla Technical High School, in 1965 there was 1,480 students enrolled. Students were sent to Memorial Oval Primary School because there wasn't enough room to hold them all at the school. Soon after this Eyre Technical High School was opened as a year 8 to 12 school.\n\nIn 1971, the school changed its name from Whyalla Technical High School to Whyalla High School. In the late 1980s, Whyalla High Schools student population was the largest of the three government high schools. However Eyre High Schools numbers had fallen and the school was expected to close. The state government however decided that Eyre High School should stay due to its proximity to the TAFE and UniSA campus. A plan was created where Eyre High School would become the Year 11-12 school, and Stuart and Whyalla High Schools would cater for years 8 to 10. Despite great opposition from the Stuart High and Whyalla High parents and students, the plan went ahead and the last group of year 12 students finished in 1991. In 1991 the Whyalla Secondary College was established and the portable buildings were removed from Whyalla High School.Whyalla, South Australia.\n\nIn 1998-2001 the school had record low enrolments, only having around 180 students, in 1998 only 40 students enrolled at Whyalla High School. This brought up the question \"Was Whyalla High School needed?\". There was discussion of the school closing but because of the rise in enrolments the school was saved. Between 2002 and 2007 the school has gone from 180 enrolments to 400. Currently the school has 386 students enrolled.\n\nThe original school building is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.\n\nWhyalla High School is proposed to be merged with Stuart High School and Edward John Eyre High School. The new merged school is intended to be on a new campus on Nicolson Avenue, Whyalla Norrie between the Whyalla campuses of the University of South Australia and TAFE SA and expected to open for the 2022 school year."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Whyalla High School", "description": "A high school located in Whyalla, South Australia catering for school years 8-10", "types": ["Educational

He was one of the leaders of the Radical Republican faction of the Republican Party during the 1860s. A fierce opponent of slavery and discrimination against African Americans, Stevens sought to secure their rights during Reconstruction, leading the opposition to U.S. President Andrew Johnson. As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee during the American Civil War, he played a leading role, focusing his attention on defeating the Confederacy, financing the war with new taxes and borrowing, crushing the power of slave owners, ending slavery, and securing equal rights for the Freedmen.\n\nStevens was born in rural Vermont, in poverty, and with a club foot, which left him with a permanent limp. He moved to Pennsylvania as a young man and quickly became a successful lawyer in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. He interested himself in municipal affairs, and then in politics. He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, where he became a strong advocate of free public education. Financial setbacks in 1842 caused him to move his home and practice to the larger city of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. There, he joined the Whig Party, and was elected to Congress in 1848. His activities as a lawyer and politician in opposition to slavery cost him votes and he did not seek reelection in 1852. After a brief flirtation with the Know-Nothing Party, Stevens joined the newly formed Republican Party, and was elected to Congress again in 1858. There, with fellow radicals such as Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, he opposed the expansion of slavery and concessions to the South as the war came.\n\nStevens argued that slavery should not survive the war; he was frustrated by the slowness of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln to support his position. He guided the government's financial legislation through the House as Ways and Means chairman. As the war progressed towards a Northern victory, Stevens came to believe that not only should slavery be abolished, but that African-Americans should be given a stake in the South's future through the confiscation of land from planters to be distributed to the freedmen (see 40 acres and a mule). His plans went too far for the Moderate Republicans and were not enacted.\n\nAfter the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in April 1865, Stevens came into conflict with the new president, Johnson, who sought rapid restoration of the seceded states without guarantees for freedmen. The difference in views caused an ongoing battle between Johnson and Congress, with Stevens leading the Radical Republicans. After gains in the 1866 election the radicals took control of Reconstruction away from Johnson. Stevens's last great battle was to secure in the House articles of impeachment against Johnson, though the Senate did not convict the President. Historiographical views of Stevens have dramatically shifted over the years, from the early 20th-century view of Stevens as reckless and motivated by hatred of the white South, to the perspective of the neoabolitionists of the 1950s and afterwards, who applauded him for his commitment to equality."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Thaddeus Stevens", "description": "Thaddeus Stevens was a Radical

writer Alfred Jarry, then 23 years old. It was first performed in Paris on December 10, 1896, by Aur\u00e9lien Lugn\u00e9-Poe's Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'\u0152uvre at Nouveau-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, 15, rue Blanche, in the 9th arrondissement (today, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Paris). The play--scheduled for an invited \"industry\" run-through, followed by a single public performance the next night--caused a riotous response in the audience and denunciatory reviews in the days after. It is considered a wild, bizarre and comic play, significant for the way it overturns cultural rules, norms, and conventions. To some of those who were in the audience on opening night, including W. B. Yeats and the poet and essayist Catulle Mend\u00e8s, it seemed an event of revolutionary importance, but many were mystified and outraged by the seeming childishness, obscenity, and disrespect of the piece. It is now seen by some to have opened the door for what became known as modernism in the twentieth century. It is a precursor to Dada, Surrealism and the Theatre of the Absurd. It is the first of three stylised burlesques in which Jarry satirises power, greed, and their evil practices\u2014in particular the propensity of the complacent bourgeoisie to abuse the authority engendered by success.\n\nThe title is sometimes translated as \"King Turd\"; however, the word \"Ubu\" is actually merely a nonsense word that evolved from the French pronunciation of the name \"Hebert\", which was the name of one of Jarry's teachers who was the satirical target and inspirer of the first versions of the play.\n\nJarry made some suggestions regarding how his play should be performed. He wanted King Ubu to wear a cardboard horse's head in certain scenes, \"as in the old English theatre\", for he intended to \"write a \"guignol\"\". He thought a \"suitably costumed person would enter, as in puppet shows, to put up signs indicating the locations of the various scenes\". He also wanted costumes with as little specific local colour reference or historical accuracy as possible.\n\n\"Ubu Roi\" was followed by \"Ubu Cocu\" (\"Ubu Cuckolded\") and \"Ubu Encha\u00een\u00e9\" (\"Ubu in Chains\"), neither of which was performed during Jarry's 34-year life. One of his later works, a novel/essay on \"pataphysics\", is offered as an explanation behind the ideas that underpin \"Ubu Roi\".

The Verleysen brothers are the sole composers and songwriters of their albums. They are both vocalists, with Jonathan playing guitar and Maxime the keyboards. Their live performances include Clement Plaza-Illand playing the drums.\n\nThey are currently signed to Blackbird / Affection London / Musicast and are managed by Yamani 'Momo' Dazi (who previously co-founded the label Big Cheese Records).\n\nThe formation released the EP \"Ideal Roommates\" in 2009 and were invited later that year to the prestigious Transmusicales Festival in Rennes. In 2010, the band received the first 'Prix Chorus' (Chorus Award) out of 600 possible candidates.\n\nElephanz's first album, \"Time for a Change\", was released in 2013 with a Deluxe version published in 2014. The first single is \"Stereo\" (which features in the compilation Nova Tunes 2.4 , and in the movie Les Profs 2) while the track \"Time for a Change\" was used in several TV adverts, including Fnac, Volvo, Numericable.\n\nThe band was nominated for the highly esteemed Victoires de la Musique award for 'Electronic Music Album of the Year'in 2014. The awards ceremony is the French equivalent of the Brit Awards or Grammys. Their 2014-2015 tour included 50 dates and saw the group play in iconic venues, such as La Cigale in Paris, Stereolux in Nantes, and famous festivals like Francofolies, Papillons de Nuit and Printemps de Bourges.\n\nTheir second album, \"Elephanz\", was released on October 13, 2017 with their first single \"Blowing like a Storm\" receiving airplay on FG Radio, M6 (TV channel) and W9. This second opus is remarkably different to the first, with more consistency between singles (often all relating to love, passionate, or feeling lost' as well as a more 'electro' sound, all underpinned by an improved, more slick production level. An \"Intro\" and two other tracks (\"Freakshow\" and \"American Lover\") also mix French with English lyrics.\n\nThe band started touring for this second album in late October 2017 with feature shows in Paris, Marseille, Lyons, Strasbourg, Rennes and Mulhouse in November, with more dates to follow in 2018."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Elephanz", "description": "French electro/pop duo formed

It is native to the southeastern United States, where it is present in North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. It is threatened by habitat destruction and degradation. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.\n\nThis perennial herb produces long, slender stems up to 2 meters (80 inches) long, sometimes growing erect. The leaves are each made up of several narrow leaflets, and some of the leaflets are divided further into lobes. Leaves near the base of the plant are borne on petioles. The inflorescence is a raceme or a panicle containing a few flowers each. The species is dioecious, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. The flower lacks petals. It has four or five sepals which are white or yellowish in the male flower and greenish in the female. The male to female ratio is 3:1. Blooming occurs in June and July.\n\nThere are nine populations of this plant consisting of 32 subpopulations. Twenty-four of the subpopulations are located in North Carolina and there is one in Florida. Seven subpopulations of plants have been recently discovered in Georgia; these are treated as members of this species but their taxonomy is not certain.\n\nThis plant grows in the Atlantic coastal plain province. It grows in open, moist habitat types such as savannas, bogs, and swamp forests. The soil is generally a sandy loam which is neutral or slightly acidic and wet at least part of the year. The plant can be found in spots that are moist or saturated but have no standing water. The plant also requires sun. The habitat is maintained by disturbance that keeps it clear of encroaching vegetation. Naturally this occurs during periodic wildfires. In the absence of a normal fire regime the plant grows in areas that are kept clear and open by other means, including human activities such as mowing. The plant may occur on roadsides, an area of high disturbance. Plants growing in deep shade are stunted. They also have less erect stems and delayed flowering. Sunny areas that have recently burned produce the most robust plants.\n\nThreats to the species include habitat degradation in areas where fire suppression is practiced. In these areas ecological succession occurs and large, woody vegetation moves in. The meadowrue and other herbs are shaded out or outcompeted. Habitat has been claimed for silviculture operations, and the plant cannot grow in these converted areas. While the plant is more likely to occur in disturbed areas, it does not tolerate severe disturbance such as bulldozing or herbicide application."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Thalictrum cooleyi",

It is often referred to in this context as just Millbrook; it is also sometimes called by its original name, Daheim.\n\nThe (or ) estate was purchased in stages by assembling five farms, beginning in 1889, by German-born acetylene gas mogul Charles F. Dieterich (1836\u20131927), a founder of Union Carbide. In 1912 Addison Mizner designed the four-story 38-room mansion which Dieterich named \"Daheim\" (\"Home\"). Featuring turrets, verandas, and gardens, the late-Victorian mansion has been described architecturally as Queen Anne style or Bavarian Baroque. The estate also featured a large gatehouse, horse stables, and other outbuildings.\n\nOwnership of the estate passed from Dieterich's heirs to oilman Walter C. Teagle and then to the Hitchcock family. Siblings William Mellon \"Billy\" Hitchcock, Tommy Hitchcock III, and Margaret Mellon \"Peggy\" Hitchcock, heirs to the Mellon fortune (children of Tommy Hitchcock Jr., grandchildren of oilman William Larimer Mellon, Sr., and great-great-grandchildren of Mellon fortune founder Thomas Mellon), who were familiar with Timothy Leary's work and Leary personally, gave the estate over for use by Leary in 1963. Peggy Hitchcock was director of Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert's International Federation for Internal Freedom (IFIF)'s New York branch, and her brother Billy rented the estate to IFIF (later re-named the Castalia Foundation).\n\nLeary and the group he gathered around him lived at the estate and performed research into psychedelics there. The Castalia Foundation also hosted weekend retreats on the estate where people paid to undergo the psychedelic experience without drugs, through meditation, yoga, and group therapy sessions. Leary, Alpert, and Ralph Metzner wrote the 1964 book \"The Psychedelic Experience\" at the mansion. People who lived at the estate included Richard Alpert and Maynard Ferguson, while the numerous visitors and guests included R. D. Laing, Alan Watts, Allen Ginsberg, Charles Mingus, Helen Merrill, and Ivy League academics. Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters visited in their bus \"Further\" but were unable to meet with Leary. Nina Graboi described Millbrook as \"a cross between a country club, a madhouse, a research institute, a monastery, and a Fellini movie set. When you entered you were greeted by a sign that asked you to 'kindly check your esteemed ego at the door.'\" \n\nDuring Leary's residence at the mansion (1963\u20131968) the culture and ambiance there evolved from scholarly research into psychedelics to a more party-oriented atmosphere, exacerbated by an increasing stream of visitors, some youthful and of the hippie persuasion. The mansion was the target of drug raids. Leary and his group were evicted in 1968, and Leary moved to California.\n\nThe mansion was later boarded up and fell into disrepair, including structural degradation. But after about two decades of effort it is () habitable although not modernized. It is still owned by the Hitchcock family. In 2003, Hudsonia Institute scientists discovered on the estate a circumneutral bog lake (a spring fed calcareous body of water that usually supports the vegetation of both acidic bogs and calcareous marshes), rare in the area and worthy of preservation."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "The Hitchcock Estate", "description": "A historic mansion and surrounding grounds associated with Timothy Leary and the psychedelic movement.", "types": ["Historic site", "Mansion", "Grounds", "Psychedelic movement"]}, {"label": "Millbrook", "description": "A nickname for the Hitchcock Estate, associated with Timothy Leary and the psychedelic movement.", "types": ["Nickname", "Historic site", "Mansion", "Grounds", "Psychedelic movement"]}, {"label": "Charles F.

He studied philosophy, theology and literature at the University of Helsinki.\n\nIn 1959 he made his first trip abroad, to Copenhagen, a city that became and has remained a foreign focal point for him. The years 1979-1982 he lived in Stockholm before returning to Finland, first to Central Finland and then, in 1999, to his native Helsinki.\n\nSince his youth he tried his hand in some 40 different professions, the more serious of which were working as a teacher for the socially handicapped for five years and as a software consultant for Nokia computers for nine years.\n\nIn 1982 he published his first novel, \"Kun p\u00e4\u00e4ttyy Pitk\u00e4silta / Where ends the Longbridge\" (second edition 1992, third 1997). With the publication of his second novel, \"Kuin unta ja varjoa / Like dream and shadow\", in 1983, he became a full-time writer. Since then he has written more than 20 works, including novels, aphorisms, poems, essays, plays and non-fiction. He has also edited several books and been a co-writer of around 50 books. Parts of his production have been translated into Danish, Swedish, German, Estonian and Russian. Torsti Lehtinen has also been active as a translator. His translations include the main works of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, as well as works from Swedish and English.\n\nTorsti Lehtinen has taught philosophy and creative writing at many Finnish universities and academic institutions, and has held seminars and given lectures at, amongst others, the universities of Helsinki, Tartu and Reykjavik, and the Nordens folkliga akademi in Gothenburg.\n\nHe has been awarded several literature prizes, e.g. The WSOY Literature Award, and he won The National Biennial Championships in Essayism in 1995.\n\nTorsti Lehtinen served on the board of the Central Finland Writers\u2019 Association, and, after moving back to Helsinki, was invited to become president of the Helsinki Writers\u2019 Guild in 2003. He also served as vice-president of the Finnish Writers\u2019 Association (2000\u20132005) and was created an honorary member of The Central-Finland Writers\u2019 Association in 1995.\n\nHis latest novel \"Kainin Merkki\" or \"The Mark of Cain\" was published by Arktinen Banaani in September 2013."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Torsti Lehtinen", "description": "Finnish writer and

The split-octonions also form an octonion algebra over R. Up to R-algebra isomorphism, these are the only octonion algebras over the reals. The algebra of bioctonions is the octonion algebra over the complex numbers C.\n\nThe octonion algebra for \"N\" is a division algebra if and only if the form \"N\" is anisotropic. A split octonion algebra is one for which the quadratic form \"N\" is isotropic (i.e., there exists a non-zero vector \"x\" with \"N\"(\"x\") = 0). Up to \"F\"-algebra isomorphism, there is a unique split octonion algebra over any field \"F\". When \"F\" is algebraically closed or a finite field, these are the only octonion algebras over \"F\".\n\nOctonion algebras are always nonassociative. They are, however, alternative algebras, alternativity being a weaker form of associativity. Moreover, the Moufang identities hold in any octonion algebra. It follows that the invertible elements in any octonion algebra form a Moufang loop, as do the elements of unit norm.\n\nThe construction of general octonion algebras over an arbitrary field \"k\" was described by Leonard Dickson in his book \"Algebren und ihre Zahlentheorie\" (1927) (Seite 264) and repeated by Max Zorn. The product depends on selection of a \u03b3 from \"k\". Given \"q\" and \"Q\" from a quaternion algebra over \"k\", the octonion is written \"q\" + \"Q\"e. Another octonion may be written \"r\" + \"R\"e.

His father's family name was originally \"Schoning,\" but he changed it to \"van Mastricht\" on moving to Cologne. Petrus occasionally used the Latinized pseudonym Scheuneneus. Johannes Hoornbeeck was Masticht's pastor from 1639 to 1643 and his teacher at the University of Utrecht starting in 1647, along with Gisbertus Voetius and others. From 1650 to 1652 he took a tour of study at Leiden University and possibly Oxford and the University of Heidelberg. From there he took pastorates at Xanten, Gl\u00fcckstadt, Frankfurt an der Oder, and Duisburg. While Mastricht is considered to be a follower of the school of Voetius, his Classis (ecclesiastical) in Xanten was predominantly Cocceian, a school to which Voetians were opposed. For this reason, and because of some irenic statements Mastricht made, he is considered to have been somewhat ecumenical in contrast to the vitriolic polemics common between Voetians and Coccieans of his day. He completed his master of arts and doctor of theology at the University of Duisburg in 1669 while serving as a pastor. Mastricht served as professor of Hebrew and theology at that university from 1670 to 1677. He then succeeded Voetius as professor of Hebrew and theology at the University of Utrecht in 1677. He also served as an elder and supply preacher for the classis of Amsterdam. He served there until he became too infirm and began teaching at home in 1700. He died February 9, 1706.\n\nMastricht, following his teachers Voetius and Hoornbeeck, saw theology as essentially practical, but did not see the use of scholastic theological method as antithetical to the practical use of theology for Christian piety. He opposed the rising influence of Cartesianism among the Reformed by writing treatises against Christopher Wittich, Petrus Allinga, and Balthasar Bekker.\n\nA growing scholarship is anticipated in the fields of Post-reformation and Jonathan Edwards studies as translations of Mastricht's \"magnum opus\" of theology, the \"Theoretico-practica theologia\", in an English edition and a new Dutch edition are released to the market in 2018.

Hull Ionians, also newly promoted, were the second team to be relegated after losing their rescheduled match at home to Blackheath on 14 March - Ionians having six games still to play. \n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom the Rugby Football Union officially cancelled the season after an initially suspension of all rugby in England including training, from which was scheduled to last until 14 April 2020. After the cancellation was announced the RFU used a best playing record formula to decide the final table. This meant that Richmond, who had been 7 points clear when the league had been suspended, were crowned as champions, beating off stiff opposition from Rosslyn Park (who beat Richmond home and away) and newly promoted Rams, who had a fantastic debut season in the third tier. Richmond's title was their third at level 3, and tied them with Coventry and Otley as the clubs that had the most league titles. It also was the fourth time Richmond had been promoted from tier 3 - a divisional record. \n\nWith two relegation spots already decided, it was tough luck for Rotherham Titans who were designated as the third team to go down, despite a late surge which had seen them gaining ground on 13th placed Birmingham Moseley. It was also a great fall for a side that were once playing in the Premiership and the lowest level for the club since the mid 1990s. Richmond would return to the 2020\u201321 RFU Championship after one season away, while Rotherham Titans and Hull Ionians would fall to 2020\u201321 National League North and Canterbury to 2020\u201321 National League South.\n\nAnother interesting statistic from the season was Brandon Asher-Wood's 7 tries for Darlington Mowden Park's resounding win against Hull Ionians on 21 December 2019. Wood's tries equalled the league record of 7 previously set by Hugo Ellis of Rosslyn Park back in the 2012\u201313 season."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "National League 1", "description": "The

Organized by Don Wilsun and Joe Scozzy as a grass-roots outlet for poetic expression across cultural and societal boundaries, it became an alternative to the academic reading series controlled (\"captive\" was the Dogtown term for it) by University of Washington professor Nelson Bentley.\n\nDogtown featured free readings every Sunday afternoon in a vacant space below Seattle's signature Pike Place Market, a large space featuring one wall of windows giving views of the generally rainy and gray Puget Sound, a pot-bellied iron stove to drive the chill and damp away for readings and heat the pot of free Market Spice tea, and a piano. Readings were often attended by winos seeking heat and a free cup of wine, tourists who wandered down from the Market, poetry fans, and a cadre of restless young Seattle poets who found the open atmosphere liberating and challenging.\n\nMany authors read at Dogtown, including Steven \"Jesse\" Bernstein, a multi-published legend who toured with punk groups and recorded albums on the same SubPop label that brought Nirvana to the world. Other poets who contributed heavily to the rich aural adventure of Dogtown and went on to future writing of note were Charlie Burks, Charlie Burks, the coordinator of the first Bumbershoot Writers in Performance Competition in 1981, Britt Robson, Hans Skott-Myre, Linton Robinson, Cliff Finity, and Don Wilsun, who founding the Red Sky Poetry Theatre in continuance of the Dogtown tradition.\n\nDogtown's impact lingered, but its performances only took place for a little over a year, from 1975 to 1976. The material presented there was as eclectic as is possible to get: wino blitherings, romance poems by starry-eyed ing\u00e9nues, strict academic forms, and performance art (such as playing recordings of conversations in Market bars while passing around samples of trash and cigarette butts gleaned from the tables where they were taped). But the general feel tended towards a sort of retro-beat aesthetic. Tom Waits and Patty Smith were cited as influences by many of the poets mentioned above, as well as Burroughs, Bukowski, and other denizens of the twilight zones between beat, hip, and grunge.\n\nThe readings ceased in 1976 and Red Sky quickly emerged from the ashes to have a more enduring effect. But Dogtown was an important part of the poetic blast of that time, dovetailing in with SubPop and other grunge, Eidolon, precursors of \"The Stranger\" in forging a verbal esthetic that was more influential on Eighties and Nineties culture than is widely known."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Dogtown Poetry Theater", "description": "A short-lived but influential venue for poetry readings

Many of his works are based on Ukrainian folklore and stories from lives of Ukrainian peasants. He initially wrote in Russian. In 1861 Oleksa Storozhenko became known as Ukrainian-language writer. His works were published in \"Osnova\" journal (Ukrainian journal published in Saint Petersburg). However, measures undertaken by the Imperial Russia\u2019s agencies enforcing the \"Valuev Circular\" (a legal decree reflecting persecution against the Ukrainian language) became the reason why Oleksa Storozhenko had to continue his writings in Russian.\n\nStorozhenko\u2019s style of writing is marked by earthy Ukrainian language and picturesque representation of the folk proverbs, anecdotes, sayings and songs. The leading topics of his works are: Ukrainians\u2019 everyday life, customs, folklore and demonological believes, historical events, particularly kozaks and Zaporozhian Sich.\n\nNovella \"Zakokhanyi Chort\" (Devil in Love) and novel \"Marko Prokliatyi\" (Damned Marko) are fine examples of Gothic-Romantic literature. Literary critics find parallel between Storozhenko\u2019s \"Devil in Love\" and \"Le Diable Amoureux\" (\"The Devil in Love\", 1772) by the French gothic author, Jacques Cazotte.\n\n1858 \u2013 \"Rasskazy iz Krestyanskogo Byta Malorossiian\" (Stories from the Peasant Life of Little Russians).\n\n1857 \u2013 \"Bratiya Bliznetsy\" (Twin Brothers; historical novel).\n\n1861 \u2013 \"Zakokhanyi Chort\" (Devil in Love)\n\n1863 \u2013 \"Ukrainski Opovidannia\" (Ukrainian Stories; a two-volume collection of short stories, which author wrote in 1850, was published in Saint-Petersburg).\n\n1870 \u2013 \"Marko Prokliatyi\" (Damned Marko; gothic novel, unfinished) \u041enly two first chapters of the novel were published during Storozhenko\u2019s life (\"Pravda\" (The Truth) Lviv, 1870).\n\nStorozhenko\u2019s other titles include: \"Vchy linyvoho ne molotom a holodom\" (Teach the Lazy Man not by Hammer but by Hunger), \"Mezhyhorodskyi did\" (The Old Man from Mezhyhorod), \"Vusy\" (The Moustache), \"Holka\" (The Needle) and \"Matusyne Blahoslovennia\" (Mother's Blessing)."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Oleksa Storozhenko", "description": "Ukrainian writer,

He was born in Pryluky in the Russian Empire (now in Ukraine) and emigrated to the United States in 1920. Chernev was a national master-strength player and was devoted to chess. He wrote that he \"probably read more about chess, and played more games than any man in history.\"\n\nChernev's deep love for the game is obvious to any reader of his books. Chess historian Edward Winter commented:\n:Although Chess Notes items have shown that he sometimes cut corners, he was active at a time when writing and scholarship were not regarded as a natural pairing and when anecdotes and other chestnuts were particularly prevalent. Few were interested in sources. Above all, in the pre-digital age the work of writers in his field was far harder; they could not fill in gaps in their knowledge with press-of-a-button 'research'. \u2026\n\n: Chernev's output \u2014 clear, humorous and easy-going \u2014 gave the impression of effortlessness, but much industry lay behind it all. \u2026\n\n: Although his prose was often conversational, it was literate and carefully structured, bearing no resemblance to the ultra-casual 'I'm-just-one-of-the-lads' stuff increasingly seen in chess books and magazines since his time. We have also been struck by the scarcity of typographical errors in Chernev's writing throughout his life.\n\nHe wrote 20 chess books, among them: \"Chessboard Magic!\", \"The Bright Side of Chess\", \"The Fireside Book of Chess\" (with Fred Reinfeld), \"The Most Instructive Games of Chess Ever Played\", \"1000 Best Short Games of Chess\", \"Practical Chess Endings\", \"Combinations: The Heart of Chess\", and \"Capablanca's Best Chess Endings\", the last of these being highly regarded by Edward Winter:\n\n:Published by the Oxford University Press in 1978 and reprinted by Dover in 1982, \"Capablanca's Best Chess Endings\" by Irving Chernev presents (in full algebraic notation) sixty complete games, annotated with emphasis on the final phase. Well over half are absent from the Golombek volume, a fact which underscores not only the inadequacy of Golombek's selection but also Chernev's readiness to embrace newly-found material. Written with deceptive casualness, \"Capablanca's Best Chess Endings\" was, perhaps, Chernev's finest book, combining hard analytical work and his customary screwball levity. Only Chernev could write annotations like (page 169) '\u201cDon't simplify against Capablanca!\u201d, I keep telling them at the office'.\n\nIn 1945, he and Kenneth Harkness wrote \"An Invitation to Chess\", which became one of the most successful chess books ever written, with sales reaching six figures. Perhaps his most famous book is \"Logical Chess: Move by Move\", first released in 1957. This takes 33 classic games from 1889 to 1952, played by masters such as Capablanca; Alekhine; and Tarrasch, and explains them in an instructive manner. An algebraic notation version was published by Batsford in 1998, with minor alterations to the original text. Chernev died in San Francisco in 1981. He was survived by his wife, Selma Kulik, and their son Melvin Chernev."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Irving Chernev", "description": "A chess player and author of 20 chess books", "types":

It was established under Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.\n\nThe FLRA was adopted after President Jimmy Carter sought legislation to bring comprehensive reform to civil service system and regularize federal labor relations. The Statute consolidated the functions of the Federal Labor Relations Council and the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations into a newly established Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), charged with overseeing elections and protecting federal government employees' organizing and bargaining rights.. One commentator suggested that the legislative negotiations that resulted in the FSLMRS \"so muddied the content and intent of the new agency that no one knew what it was supposed to do or how it was supposed to do it.\" Over time, there were modifications in the coverage and responsibilities specified in the Statute.\n\nIn passing the Statute, Congress declared that it wished to encourage collective bargaining between federal employees and their employers. Congress declared that collective bargaining is \"in the public interest\" because, among other things, it \"contributes to the effective conduct of public business\" and \"facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes between employees and their employers involving conditions of employment.\"\n\nWith only a few major exceptions, it is patterned on the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).\n\nOne important difference between the two laws is the scope of the authorized collective bargaining process. While private-sector employees are entitled to collectively bargain through a representative of their choosing with respect to wages, hours, benefits, and other working conditions, federal employees can collectively bargain with respect to personnel practices only. Thus, federal employees may not negotiate the following working conditions through their exclusive bargaining representative: Wages, Hours, Employee benefits, and Classifications of Jobs.\n\nAnother important difference is although the NLRA allows private sector employees to engage in \"concerted action,\" like workplace strikes, the Statute does not grant this right to federal employees. In fact, the Statute specifically excludes from the definition of \"employee\" those persons who engage in a workplace strike. It specifies that it is an unfair labor practice for labor unions to call or participate in a strike or a work stoppage that interferes with the operation of a federal agency.\n\nA third important difference is under the FSLMRS, it is an unfair labor practice for labor unions to call or participate in picketing that interferes with the operation of a federal agency; employee picketing under the Statute may consist of \"informational\" picketing only. Under the NLRA, appropriate picketing is a right guaranteed to private sector employees. Picketing allowed by the Statute must not disrupt the operations of the agency. It also may not occur while the employees are on duty."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute FSLMRS", "description": "A federal law that establishes collective bargaining rights for most employees of the federal government in the United States", "types": ["Law", "Labor relations"]}, {"label": "Collective bargaining", "description": "The process of negotiation between an employer and a group of employees aimed at agreements to regulate working salaries, working conditions, benefits, and other aspects of workers' compensation and rights", "types": ["Labor relations"]}, {"label": "Federal Labor Relations Authority FLRA", "description": "An agency responsible for overseeing elections and protecting federal government employees' organizing and bargaining rights", "types": ["Government agency", "Labor relations"]}, {"label": "National Labor Relations Act NLRA", "description": "A federal law that governs labor relations in the private sector", "types": ["Law", "Labor relations"]}, {"label": "Unfair labor practice", "description": "Any action by either the employer or the union that violates the rights of the other party", "types": ["Labor relations"]}, {"label": "Strike", "description": "A work stoppage caused by the mass refusal of employees to work", "types": ["Labor relations"]}, {"label": "Picketing", "description": "The act of demonstrating or protesting a cause by walking or standing in a public place", "types": ["Labor relations"]}], "gold": [{"uri": "Q452421", "boundaries": [117, 138], "surfaceform": "collective bargaining", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q30", "boundaries": [198, 211], "surfaceform": "United States", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q5124568", "boundaries": [255, 287], "surfaceform": "Civil Service Reform Act of 1978", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q23685", "boundaries": [327, 339], "surfaceform": "Jimmy Carter", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q5440273", "boundaries": [624, 657], "surfaceform": "Federal Labor Relations Authority", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q1154442", "boundaries": [1603, 1638], "surfaceform": "National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q5440271", "boundaries": [4, 54], "surfaceform": "Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "1978-01-01T00:00:00Z^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime", "boundaries": [283, 287], "surfaceform": "1978", "annotator": "Date_Linker"}]}, "triples": {"gpt": [], "gold": [{"subject": {"uri": "Q5440271", "boundaries": [4, 54], "surfaceform": "Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute", "annotator": "Me"}, "predicate": {"uri": "P17", "boundaries": null, "surfaceform": "country", "annotator": "NoSubject-Triple-aligner"}, "object": {"uri": "Q30", "boundaries": [198, 211], "surfaceform": "United States", "annotator": "Me"}, "sentence_id": 0, "dependency_path": null, "confidence": null, "annotator": "NoSubject-Triple-aligner"}, {"subject": {"uri": "Q5440271", "boundaries": [4, 54], "surfaceform": "Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute", "annotator": "Me"}, "predicate": {"uri": "P361", "boundaries": null, "surfaceform": "part of", "annotator": "NoSubject-Triple-aligner"}, "object": {"uri": "Q5124568", "boundaries": [255, 287], "surfaceform": "Civil Service Reform Act of 1978", "annotator": "Me"}, "sentence_id": 1, "dependency_path": null, "confidence": null, "annotator": "NoSubject-Triple-aligner"}]}}, {"doc": {"id": "37514344", "uri": "Q7088804", "title": "Oluf Arntsen", "text": "Oluf Arntsen (born 22 March 1941) is a Norwegian businessperson and politician for the Christian Democratic Party.\n\nHe was born in Kristiansand and graduated from the University of Oslo with the cand.real. degree in 1967. He worked as a consultant in the Ministry of Education and Church Affairs and at a teachers' college before being assisting chief executive at NKI-skolen. During Korvald's Cabinet from 1972 to 1973, he was a State Secretary, first in the Ministry of Local Government and Labour, then in the Office of the Prime Minister. After that he held another political position, secretary-general of the Christian Democratic Party, before he was director of enterprise in Vestfold County Municipality. He was then a director in Anders Jahre/Kosmos from 1982 to 1988, before being hired as chief executive officer of Sparebanken Pluss. He retired in 2001 and was replaced by Stein A. Hannevik.\n\nHe has been chairman of the Norwegian Banks' Guarantee Fund, the Norwegian Industrial and Regional Development Fund, Mediehuset V\u00e5rt Land as well as the corporate council and election committee of Statoil. In late December 2002 he became chairman of the Southern Norway Regional Health Authority. His tenure was marked by turbulence. The chief executive Steinar Stokke had to step down from several hospital boards in May 2003 because of a flawed project where patient diagnoses was to be coded in different ways to be eligible for public funding. In January 2004, Arntsen tried to oust Stokke from the executive chair, following the \"coding case\" as well as roundhanded pension deals with company executives. Arntsen was supported by deputy chair Helen Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8y and board member Ole Johan Sandvand, but was voted down by the rest of the board (Kaare Norum, Einfrid Halvorsen, Anne Mo Grimdalen, Terje Keyn, Morten Falkenberg and Svein \u00d8verland). Arntsen subsequently had to resign, but in response, the Minister of Health Dagfinn H\u00f8ybr\u00e5ten promptly relieved the entire board of their positions. Stokke resigned the next month.\n\nArntsen is also a former supervisory council member of Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse, and has led the political-financial committee of the Norwegian Savings Banks Association. In 1999 he led the Arntsen Committee which drew out the principles for that year's central wage negotiations in Norway.

is a widely used English-language thesaurus, created in 1805 by Peter Mark Roget (1779\u20131869), British physician, natural theologian and lexicographer. It was released to the public on 29 April 1852. The original edition had 15,000 words and each successive edition has been larger, with the most recent edition (the eighth) containing 443,000 words. Roget was inspired by the Utilitarian teachings of Jeremy Bentham and wished to help \"those who are painfully groping their way and struggling with the difficulties of composition [...] this work processes to hold out a helping hand.\" The Karpeles Library Museum houses the original manuscript in its collection.\n\nThe name \"Roget\" is trademarked in parts of the world, such as the United Kingdom. By itself, it is not protected in the United States, where use of the name \"Roget\" in the title of a thesaurus does not necessarily indicate any relationship to Roget directly; it has come to be seen as a generic thesaurus name. With its hegemonic status, it became \"a mark of civility.\" J.M. Barrie stated \"[Captain Hook] is not wholly evil [h]e has a Thesaurus in his cabin.\" Indeed, Sylvia Plath considered it her desert island book over the Bible.\n\nRoget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:\n\nIt is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.\n\"Roget's Thesaurus\" is composed of six primary classes. Each class is composed of multiple divisions and then sections. This may be conceptualized as a tree containing over a thousand branches for individual \"meaning clusters\" or semantically linked words. Although these words are not strictly synonyms, they can be viewed as colours or connotations of a meaning or as a spectrum of a concept. One of the most general words is chosen to typify the spectrum as its headword, which labels the whole group.\n\nRoget's schema of classes and their subdivisions is based on the philosophical work of Leibniz (see ), itself following a long tradition of epistemological work starting with Aristotle. Some of Aristotle's Categories are included in Roget's first class \"abstract relations.\" \n\nThe book is updated regularly and each edition is heralded as a gauge to contemporary terms; but each edition keeps true to the original classifications established by Roget."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Roget's Thesaurus", "description": "A widely used English-language thesaurus created by Peter Mark Roget.", "types": ["Reference book", "Language tool"]}, {"label": "Peter Mark Roget", "description": "British physician, natural theologian, and lexicographer who created Roget's Thesaurus.", "types": ["Person", "Author"]}, {"label": "Utilitarian teachings", "description": "The philosophical teachings of Jeremy Bentham that inspired Roget to create his thesaurus.", "types": ["Philosophy", "Ethics"]}, {"label": "Karpeles Library Museum", "description": "The museum that houses the original manuscript of Roget's Thesaurus.", "types": ["Museum", "Institution"]}, {"label": "Manuscript", "description": "The original handwritten copy of Roget's Thesaurus.", "types": ["Document", "Artifact"]}, {"label": "Trademark", "description": "A symbol or name that is legally registered to represent a product or company.", "types": ["Law", "Intellectual property"]}, {"label": "Thesaurus", "description": "A reference book that lists words in groups of synonyms and related concepts.", "types": ["Reference book", "Language tool"]}, {"label": "J.M.

The computer would then run a simulation of the brain's information processing, such that it would respond in essentially the same way as the original brain and experience having a sentient conscious mind.\n\nSubstantial mainstream research in related areas is being conducted in animal brain mapping and simulation, development of faster supercomputers, virtual reality, brain\u2013computer interfaces, connectomics, and information extraction from dynamically functioning brains. According to supporters, many of the tools and ideas needed to achieve mind uploading already exist or are currently under active development; however, they will admit that others are, as yet, very speculative, but say they are still in the realm of engineering possibility.\n\nMind uploading may potentially be accomplished by either of two methods: Copy-and-upload or copy-and-delete by gradual replacement of neurons (which can be considered as a gradual destructive uploading), until the original organic brain no longer exists and a computer program emulating the brain takes control over the body. In the case of the former method, mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and mapping the salient features of a biological brain, and then by storing and copying, that information state into a computer system or another computational device. The biological brain may not survive the copying process or may be deliberately destroyed during it in some variants of uploading. The simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or simulated world, supported by an anatomic 3D body simulation model. Alternatively the simulated mind could reside in a computer inside (or either connected to or remotely controlled) a (not necessarily humanoid) robot or a biological or cybernetic body.\n\nAmong some futurists and within the part of transhumanist movement, mind uploading is treated as an important proposed life extension technology. Some believe mind uploading is humanity's current best option for preserving the identity of the species, as opposed to cryonics. Another aim of mind uploading is to provide a permanent backup to our \"mind-file\", to enable interstellar space travels, and a means for human culture to survive a global disaster by making a functional copy of a human society in a computing device. Whole brain emulation is discussed by some futurists as a \"logical endpoint\" of the topical computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics fields, both about brain simulation for medical research purposes. It is discussed in artificial intelligence research publications as an approach to strong AI (Artificial general intelligence) and to at least weak superintelligence. Another approach is seed AI, which wouldn't be based on existing brains. Computer-based intelligence such as an upload could think much faster than a biological human even if it were no more intelligent. A large-scale society of uploads might, according to futurists, give rise to a technological singularity, meaning a sudden time constant decrease in the exponential development of technology.

Island Times was one of three newspapers on the Hawaiian island of Moloka'i. It was founded in December 2004 by Brennan Purtzer and Darrell Williams with a subsidy from computer software guru John McAfee, Williams' English cousin, and served as the newest community paper for \"The Friendly Isle\" of Molokai from 2005\u20132006, before becoming known as The Molokai Times in January 2007.\n\nIt provided news relevant to the Molokai community, along with coverage of sports and politics. The newspaper's stated goal was \"to entertain while maintaining the utmost journalistic integrity.\" The declaration in every issue of the broadsheet publication was, \"If it happens here ... it's in here.\"\n\nHawaiian Pacific Media's Brennan Purtzer purchased Williams' interest in the company in October 2006. With new operating partner Tim Kline they expanded the capacities of the newspaper in several electronic formats. In January 2007, The \"Molokai Island Times\" re-branded itself as \"The Molokai Times\", and was published by Hawaiian Pacific Media, LLC, operated jointly by Tim Kline and Brennan Purtzer.\n\nIn June 2007 \"The Molokai Times\" hired a new editor to oversee the production of the weekly newspaper. David Lichtenstein, a newspaper professional with over 20 years of journalism and editorial experience, came from Colorado to work on the newspaper.\n\nWith the arrival of Lichtenstein, Purtzer moved out of the role of editor, and assumed responsibility for the newspaper's publication, also acting as HPM's CEO and Editor of The \"Hawaii Golf Journal\". The Publisher role at \"The Molokai Times\" was taken over by Kline in December 2007, when Purtzer left to temporarily work on the national media team for a 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nIn May 2008, the paper was sold to new owner/operators in the form of Lester Keanini and Eric Wong, Molokai-born native Hawaiians.\n\nIn September 2008, the newspaper announced it was closing down its operations.\n\n\"The Molokai Times\" remains inactive as a Molokai island newspaper (as of 2009) and there is no announced intent to restart either the publication or its internet site. This leaves the island of Molokai with its older news publication, the \"Molokai Dispatch\" (published in Kaunakakai) and one other paper published weekly on the east end of the island, the \"Molokai

It started as a grassroots effort to support locally owned and operated bookshops, many of which have struggled to compete with large bookstore chains and online retailers.\n\nThe project was initiated in 2003 by Larry Portzline, a writer and college instructor in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania who led \"bookstore road trips\" to other cities and recognized its potential as a group travel niche and marketing tool. He promoted the concept with a how-to book and a web site, and groups around the U.S. soon began offering similar excursions, usually via a chartered bus, and often incorporating book signings, author home tours, and historical sites. The most famous bookstore tourism destination is Hay-on-Wye in Wales. In 2005-06, two regional booksellers associations\u2014the Southern California Booksellers Association and the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association\u2014embraced Bookstore Tourism, offering trips to independent bookstores in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco.\n\nThe Bookstore Tourism movement encourages schools, libraries, reading groups, and organizations of all sizes to create day-trips and literary outings to cities and towns with a concentration of independent bookstores. It also encourages local booksellers to attract bibliophiles to their communities by employing bookstore tourism as an economic development tool. Others benefiting include local retailers, restaurants, bus companies, and travel professionals.\n\nThe effort also provides organizations with an outreach opportunity to support reading and literacy.\n\nPortzline has traveled across the country to promote the concept. In 2006 he created a promotional video featuring group \"bookstore road trips\" in New York City's Greenwich Village and in Los Angeles area \"beach towns\" and posted it on the Bookstore Tourism website.\n\nPortzline took a year off in 2008, and in early 2009 began to promote the effort again, partly in response to the effects of the U.S. financial crisis on independent booksellers.\n\nIn 2007, \"The New York Times\" argued that the Pioneer Valley in Western Massachusetts, is the \"most author-saturated, book-cherishing, literature-celebrating place in\" the United States. In particular, it discussed three bookshops in the region, \"Amherst Books\" in Amherst, Massachusetts, \"Broadside Bookshop\" in Northampton, Massachusetts, and \"The Odyssey Bookshop\" in South Hadley, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 2008, \"USA Today\" listed nine top bookstore travel destinations in the United States as: \"Books & Books\" in Coral Gables, Florida; \"City Lights Books\" in San Francisco; the \"Elliott Bay Book Company\" in Seattle; \"Politics and Prose\" in Washington, DC; \"Powell's Books\" in Portland, Oregon; \"Prairie Lights\" in Iowa City, Iowa; \"Tattered Cover\" in Denver, Colorado; \"That Bookstore in Blytheville\" in Blytheville, Arkansas; and the \"Strand Book Store\" in New York City.\n\nBookstore tourism is encouraged by organizations such as the Massachusetts and Rhode Island Antiquarian Booksellers (MARIAB). Founded in 1976, the organization has 125 business members , publicizes its member bookstores with a website and a free annual directory booklet, and sponsors an annual \"Pioneer Valley Book & Ephemera Fair\"."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Bookstore tourism", "description": "A type of cultural tourism that promotes independent bookstores as a group travel destination", "types":

bulimia, is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging. Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to the attempts to get rid of the food consumed. This may be done by vomiting or taking laxatives. Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics, stimulants, water fasting, or excessive exercise. Most people with bulimia are at a normal weight. The forcing of vomiting may result in thickened skin on the knuckles and breakdown of the teeth. Bulimia is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and problems with drugs or alcohol. There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm.\nBulimia is more common among those who have a close relative with the condition. The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30% and 80%. Other risk factors for the disease include psychological stress, cultural pressure to attain a certain body type, poor self-esteem, and obesity. Living in a culture that promotes dieting and having parents that worry about weight are also risks. Diagnosis is based on a person's medical history; however, this is difficult, as people are usually secretive about their binge eating and purging habits. Further, the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa takes precedence over that of bulimia. Other similar disorders include binge eating disorder, Kleine-Levin syndrome, and borderline personality disorder.\nCognitive behavioral therapy is the primary treatment for bulimia. Antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or tricyclic antidepressant classes may have a modest benefit. While outcomes with bulimia are typically better than in those with anorexia, the risk of death among those affected is higher than that of the general population. At 10 years after receiving treatment about 50% of people are fully recovered.\nGlobally, bulimia was estimated to affect 3.6 million people in 2015. About 1% of young women have bulimia at a given point in time and about 2% to 3% of women have the condition at some point in their lives. The condition is less common in the developing world. Bulimia is about nine times more likely to occur in women than men. Among women, rates are highest in young adults. Bulimia was named and first described by the British psychiatrist Gerald Russell in 1979."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Bulimia nervosa", "description": "An eating disorder characterized by binge

Under the care of an uncle, an Augustinian friar, he studied in the Dominican and Augustinian convents of Burgos; at Burgos, in 1785, he was formally received into the Augustinian Order. Subsequently he became professor of philosophy, first at the convent of his order at Salamanca, and then at Burgos.\n\nReturning from the latter place to Salamanca he was librarian of the university, from 1789 to 1800. After spending four years in Toledo, he came to Madrid, where he taught philosophy in the College of San Isidro. On account of certain articles in a paper of liberal tendencies called \"El Universal\", he was, on the return to Spain of King Ferdinand VII, confined for one year in a convent near \u00c1vila. At the end of this period he returned to Madrid and with his brother Augustinian, Fr. Antolin Merino, was appointed by the King to continue the monumental \"Espa\u00f1a Sagrada\" (Holy Spain), begun in 1743 by the Augustinians Henrique Fl\u00f3rez and Manuel Risco. This valuable collection of documents and researches relating to Spanish ecclesiastical history had already reached its forty-second volume. The work embraces an account of the foundation and vicissitudes of all Spanish dioceses, the succession of the Spanish hierarchy, the most important monasteries, and other matters of interest to the Spanish Church studied in their original sources. From the time of his appointment Canal devoted himself to his task.\n\nIn order to collect material for the publication, he undertook two journeys into Catalonia, making his headquarters at Barcelona and Girona, and working in the archives of these cities. In conjunction with Father Merino he published vols. XLIII-XLIV of the \"Espa\u00f1a Sagrada\" in Madrid in 1819; vols. XLV-XLVI (Madrid, 1826\u201332) were due to Father Canal alone. These volumes deal with the churches and monasteries of the diocese of Girona, and contain many hitherto unpublished documents and critical investigations. To his collaborator Father Canal dedicated a biographical study in his \"Ensayo hist\u00f3rico de la vida literaria del Maestro Fr. Antolin Merino\" (Madrid, 1830); he also published a second edition, greatly enlarged by himself, of the \"Clave historial\" (Key to History) by Father Fl\u00f3rez (Madrid, 1817) and a \"Manual del Santo Sacrificio de la Misa\" (Madrid, 1817, 1819). He translated from the French various theological and historical works, and was successively corresponding member, treasurer, censor, and director of the Royal Academy of History. He belonged to the Academy of Natural Science of Madrid, to the Academy of Belles-Lettres of Barcelona, and to the Antiquarian Society of Normandy.\n\nFather Canal was reportedly noted for charity to the poor. He refused the See of Girona in 1836 notwithstanding the entreaties of Queen Isabella II, excusing himself on the count of age and ill health, and declaring he believed he could better serve God and his country if he continued to devote the remainder of his life to historical research. He died in Madrid in 1845."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Jos\u00e9 de la Canal", "description": "Spanish ecclesiastical historian", "types": ["Historian", "Ecclesiastic", "Professor"]}, {"label": "Ucieda", "description": "Village in Cantabria, Spain", "types": ["Geographic location"]}, {"label": "Augustinian friar", "description": "Member of the Augustinian Order", "types": ["Religious figure", "Order member"]}, {"label": "Dominican and Augustinian convents of Burgos", "description": "Convents in Burgos, Spain", "types": ["Religious institution", "Geographic location"]}, {"label": "Augustinian Order", "description": "Religious order founded by Augustine of Hippo", "types": ["Religious institution", "Order"]}, {"label": "Salamanca", "description": "City in western Spain", "types": ["Geographic location"]}, {"label": "Burgos", "description": "City in northern Spain", "types": ["Geographic location"]}, {"label": "Librarian of the university", "description": "Person in charge of the university library", "types": ["Profession", "Academic"]}, {"label": "College of San Isidro", "description": "Educational institution in Madrid, Spain", "types": ["Educational institution", "Geographic location"]}, {"label": "El Universal", "description": "Newspaper with liberal tendencies", "types": ["Newspaper", "Political"]}, {"label": "King Ferdinand VII", "description": "King of Spain from 1813 to 1833", "types": ["Royalty", "Political figure"]}, {"label": "Convent near \u00c1vila", "description": "Convent located near \u00c1vila, Spain", "types": ["Religious institution", "Geographic location"]}, {"label": "Espa\u00f1a Sagrada", "description": "Collection of documents and researches relating to Spanish ecclesiastical history", "types": ["Historical work", "Religious"]}, {"label": "Henrique Fl\u00f3rez", "description": "Augustinian historian and ecclesiastic", "types": ["Historian", "Ecclesiastic", "Order member"]}, {"label": "Manuel Risco", "description": "Augustinian historian and ecclesiastic", "types": ["Historian", "Ecclesiastic", "Order member"]}, {"label": "Catalonia", "description": "Autonomous community in northeastern Spain", "types": ["Geographic location"]}, {"label": "Barcelona", "description": "City in northeastern Spain", "types": ["Geographic location"]}, {"label": "Girona", "description": "City in northeastern Spain", "types": ["Geographic location"]}, {"label": "Archives", "description": "Place where historical documents are kept", "types": ["Institution", "Historical"]}, {"label": "Diocese of Girona", "description": "Ecclesiastical territory in northeastern Spain", "types": ["Religious institution", "Geographic location"]}, {"label": "Biographical study", "description": "Research on someone's life", "types": ["Research", "Biography"]}, {"label": "Ensayo hist\u00f3rico de la vida literaria del Maestro Fr.

Her family moved through Rotterdam to England and on to New York City in 1710, where she grew up, eventually marrying a member of the same refugee group, John Peter Zenger. The couple married on 11 September 1722 in Manhattan's Dutch Reformed Church.\n\nHer husband had worked for New York printer William Bradford, advancing from an indentured servant, to a journeyman, and eventually becoming Bradford's partner in 1725. After publishing an unremarkable Dutch language book about the reformed church, the partnership dissolved and John established his own printing business. John specialized in Dutch religious and academic texts until, in 1732, he was caught up in a political scandal. That year William Cosby became the colony's new governor, and, in responsive to his perceived capriciousness, an opposition party was formed and Zenger was hired to publish their tracts and pamphlets.\n\nAs their conflict with the governor intensified, the opposition founded a newspaper, the \"New-York Weekly Journal\", with John Zenger as the editor, publisher and printer. (In actuality, Zenger was only responsible for printing; the influential lawyer James Alexander was responsible for the paper's tone and content.) In 1734, Cosby retaliated against the paper, ordering four issues to be burned in public, and John Zenger was arrested for seditious libel.\n\nJohn Zenger, unable to meet bail requirements, ultimately spent more than eight months imprisoned, and during this time Anna Catharina took over his publishing duties. Her level of control over the newspaper during this time is unclear. She is known to have regularly visited her husband in jail and took instructions from him regarding the publication. Author Kent Cooper proposed that, during John's imprisonment, Anna Catharina had editorial control and wrote articles for the paper, but other historians believe that the paper's content was provided by well-educated opposition members. On John's release in 1735, he resumed control of the paper and printing business.\n\nEleven years later, after her husband's death, Anna Catharina once again took responsibility for running both operations. She continued to publish the paper weekly, including a modest section of advertisements, along with other publications, including an annual almanac, and the printing shop also sold books and stationery.\n\nIn 1748 she gave control of the printing business to her stepson, John Zenger, Jr., and moved to a rural area outside of the city where she opened a small bookstore.

The primary river flowing through the gorge, which is up to deep, is the Bras de Caverne River, a tributary of the Rivi\u00e8re du M\u00e2t. The canyon has two distinct parts: a large crater, which is fed by six prominent waterfalls, and a narrow slot canyon at its outlet, which constitutes most of the canyon's length. The canyon starts at the waterfall of the Bras Mazerine stream and after some 1.4 - 1.8\u00a0km from the left side joins the main Bras de Caverne stream.\nThe Bras de Caverne River enters the canyon with a waterfall about high. This drop is usually dry or has very little water, but between that and the next, drop, springs feed the river, which drops over this then drops over a final undercut cliff into the Trou de Fer in a narrow plume of water.\nDirectly to the left of this waterfall, another stream drops over the cliff, which is undercut to an extent that its lip has over of empty space between it and the canyon floor, of approximately the same height in two channels, and slams onto a ledge before emptying into the same pool as the Bras de Caverne waterfall. This waterfall is not as high, and has a smaller water flow. It is fed by several other falls streaming off the cliffs above it. Further to the left, at about twice the distance from the first falls to the second, another large stream plunges into the canyon. \nIn total, there are at least six waterfalls feeding the canyon. At the base of the canyon, a separate slot canyon, or \"The Narrows\", begins. The water from the Bras de Caverne waterfall and the waterfall to its left drain into the slot canyon at a 90-degree angle, through a waterfall known informally as the \"Washing Machine\". The name stems from the mist it generates, which drenches people who stand near the base of the falls.\n\nThe slot canyon, or \"The Corridor\", extends for about , and is said to be commonly dammed up by debris jams to form lakes, including the \"Lake of the Eel\". Many springs flow through the porous volcanic rock of the walls, creating countless waterfalls.\n\nThe team of Pascale Lapoule, Laurent Broisin and Pascal Colas were the first to climb/walk the canyon on 19\u201321 September 1989."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Trou de Fer", "description": "A canyon on Reunion Island with a large crater fed by six prominent waterfalls and a narrow slot canyon at its outlet.", "types": ["canyon", "waterfall", "river"]}, {"label": "Bras de Caverne River", "description": "A primary river flowing through the Trou de Fer canyon.", "types": ["river"]}, {"label": "Rivi\u00e8re du M\u00e2t", "description": "A river that receives water from the Bras de Caverne River.", "types": ["river"]}, {"label": "The Narrows", "description": "A separate slot canyon at the base of the Trou de Fer canyon.", "types": ["slot canyon"]}, {"label": "Washing Machine", "description": "A waterfall at a 90-degree angle where the water from the Bras de Caverne waterfall and the waterfall to its left drain into the slot canyon.", "types": ["waterfall"]}, {"label": "Lake of the Eel", "description": "A lake formed by debris jams in the slot canyon of the Trou de Fer.", "types": ["lake"]}, {"label": "Pascale Lapoule", "description": "One of the three people who were the first to climb/walk the Trou de Fer canyon.", "types": ["person"]}, {"label": "Laurent Broisin", "description": "One of the three people who were the first to climb/walk the Trou de Fer canyon.", "types": ["person"]}, {"label": "Pascal Colas", "description": "One of the three people who were the first to climb/walk the Trou de Fer canyon.", "types": ["person"]}], "gold": [{"uri": "Q150784", "boundaries": [35, 41], "surfaceform": "canyon", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q17070", "boundaries": [45, 59], "surfaceform": "Reunion Island", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q1019", "boundaries": [78, 88], "surfaceform": "Madagascar", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q1239", "boundaries": [96, 108], "surfaceform": "Indian Ocean", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "None", "boundaries": [183, 204], "surfaceform": "Bras de Caverne River", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q3433924", "boundaries": [225, 239], "surfaceform": "Rivi\u00e8re du M\u00e2t", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q2294430", "boundaries": [347, 358], "surfaceform": "slot canyon", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q2294430", "boundaries": [1548, 1559], "surfaceform": "slot canyon", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q593481", "boundaries": [4, 15], "surfaceform": "Trou de Fer", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q593481", "boundaries": [825, 836], "surfaceform": "Trou de Fer", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "1989-09-21T00:00:00Z^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime", "boundaries": [2239, 2256], "surfaceform": "21 September 1989", "annotator": "Date_Linker"}, {"uri": "+1.4^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [499, 502], "surfaceform": "1.4", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}, {"uri": "+1.8^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [505, 508], "surfaceform": "1.8", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}, {"uri": "+90^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [1694, 1696], "surfaceform": "90", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}, {"uri": "+19^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [2236, 2238], "surfaceform": "19", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}]}, "triples": {"gpt": [{"subject label": "Bras de Caverne River", "predicate label": "flows through", "predicate description": "Expresses the relationship between two entities where one entity (the subject) passes through or moves within another entity (the object).

Son of an apothecary named Mauchrestien and orphan at a young age, Montchrestien came under the protection of Fran\u00e7ois Th\u00e9sart, baron de Tournebu and des Essarts, and became the valet of Th\u00e9sart's children (allowing him to participate in their studies); he would later (1618) marry Th\u00e9sart's daughter Suzanne. Later in his life he would also be favored by Henri II de Bourbon, prince de Cond\u00e9.\n\nMontchrestien initially sought a literary career (inspired by Fran\u00e7ois de Malherbe): in 1595 he published his first tragedy, \"Sophonisbe or La Carthaginoise\". In 1601, he published five more plays: the tragedies \"L'Ecossaise\" (on Mary Stuart), \"Les Lac\u00e8nes\", \"David ou l'Adult\u00e8re\", \"Aman\", and the pastoral \"La Bergerie\". In 1604, he added his tragedy \"Hector\" (which may not have been performed).\n\nMontchrestien was involved in several duels (illegal in France from 1602 on); in 1603 he was left near dead; in 1604 or 1605 he killed his opponent and was forced to flee to England temporarily to avoid royal prosecution, but most likely through the influence of James I, to whom he dedicated his tragedy, \"L'Ecossaise\", he was allowed to return to France, and he established himself at Auxonne-sur-Loire, where he set up a steel foundry.\n\nIn 1615 he published \"Traict\u00e9 de l'\u00e9conomie politique\", based chiefly on the works of Jean Bodin. In the history of economic thought, it is the first use of 'political economy' in the title of a work claiming to be a treatise. It challenged Aristotle's position on the independence of politics from other social life, including economic activities. It also developed some major elements of subsequent Mercantilist thought, such as the value of productive labor use and wealth acquisition in promoting political stability. From around this time, Montchrestien was favored with several official positions (including governor of Ch\u00e2tillon-sur-Loire in 1617) which were financially advantageous, and he took the title \"baron\" and married.\n\nIn 1620 Montchrestien joined the rebellion of the Huguenots (there is no evidence that he shared the religious opinions of the party for which he fought; he had earlier belonged to the moderate party which had rallied round Henry IV) and was forced to fight against his former protector the prince de Cond\u00e9. Unable to hold the city of Sancerre, Montchrestien returned to Normandy to attempt a raise troops, but on the night of October 7, 1621, he was discovered in an inn at Les Tourailles, near Falaise, and was killed. Tried posthumously, Montchrestien's body was put on the wheel and burned for l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Antoine de Montchrestien", "description": "French soldier,

His officiating uniform number was 59. He entered the NFL as a field judge in 1991 and officiated Super Bowl XXXI, his last game at that position before he became a referee in 1997 after Red Cashion and Howard Roe announced their retirements. He also refereed in the WLAF/NFL Europe, including being assigned World Bowl '97. He returned to the NFL back judge position in 2001, three years after the NFL switched the titles of back judge and field judge. He took a leave of absence from the NFL for the 2006 season. In 2007, he returned to officiating as the back judge on Bill Carollo's crew and retired at the end of the season. After retiring, he was employed by the league as an officiating supervisor.\n\nDuring an overtime coin toss in a November 1998 game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Detroit Lions the coin landed on tails and Luckett awarded the toss to the Lions. Steelers captain Jerome Bettis said he had called \"tails\", but Luckett insisted that Bettis had called \"heads-tails\". According to NFL rules, a team's first call is the one the referee will use, and Luckett noted in his game report to the NFL that Bettis was attempting to deceive. The Lions scored a field goal on their first possession of the overtime to win the game. The game tape was later enhanced, and Bettis is clearly heard saying \"hea-tails.\" A sideline microphone enhancement also clearly had Bettis telling coach Bill Cowher that (Bettis) had said \"hea-tails.\"\n\nFollowing this incident, the coin toss rules were changed. Now, instead of calling the toss while the coin is in the air, the team captain chooses heads or tails before the coin is flipped and the referee confirms the selection before he flips the coin.\n\nThe following week Luckett and his crew were assigned to Giants Stadium for the game between the New York Jets and the Seattle Seahawks, a game with playoff implications for both teams. Late in the game, with his team trailing, Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde attempted a quarterback sneak near the Seahawks' goal line and Luckett's head linesman Earnie Frantz signaled that he had scored the go-ahead touchdown. Various television replays showed Testaverde was clearly down by contact on the play and never crossed the goal line. Luckett, however, did not reverse the call and the play stood as the winning score in New York's 32\u201331 victory. At the time, the NFL did not use instant replay to review officials' decisions; the call would be cited as a major reason why the NFL reinstituted instant replay the following season.\n\nHe was also the referee when the Music City Miracle play occurred during the 1999 Playoffs between the Buffalo Bills and the Tennessee Titans. Despite protests, Luckett ruled that a legal lateral pass had been thrown for the game-winning touchdown, a controversial call that was much disputed, even years later.\n\nLuckett was the league supervisor assigned to the 2012 Green Bay Packers\u2013Seattle Seahawks game that contributed to the end of the 2012 NFL referee lockout."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Phil Luckett",

Berek (1896 - 1986) was a soldier of the Austro-Hungarian Army and Genera\u0142 brygady of the Polish Army, who fought in World War One, Polish\u2013Soviet War and the Invasion of Poland. \n\nBorn on August 19, 1896 in Nowy S\u0105cz, Austrian Galicia, Berek studied medicine at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w. In May 1918 he joined Polish Military Organisation, and in November of the same year he fought in the Battle of Lemberg, as leader of a company in 5th Legions' Infantry Regiment. In February 1919, Berek became company leader in the 9th Legions Infantry Regiment, stationed at Lublin. He remained in his post until April 1926, fighting in the Polish\u2013Soviet War. On June 1, 1919, Berek was promoted to major. \n\nIn the second half of 1926, Berek served in 83rd Infantry Regiment at Kobryn. In December 1926 he was transferred back to 9th Legions Infantry Regiment, and in the period May 1929 - September 1931, he attended Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Wojenna in Warsaw. After completing his officer course, he was chief of staff of the 4th Infantry Division, stationed in Toru\u0144 (1931 - 1934), and in 1934 - 36, he commanded 1st Rifle Battalion in Chojnice. Promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on January 1, 1935, Berek served at the Polish General Staff (October 1936 - July 1939). A few weeks before the Invasion of Poland, he was sent to Jaros\u0142aw, to command 3rd Legions' Infantry Regiment. Berek remained in his post until the capitulation of Modlin Fortress, on September 29, 1939 (see Battle of Modlin). \n\nAfter the capitulation of Modlin, Berek was captured and spent World War II in an Oflag. Released in May 1945, he went first to Italy and then to Great Britain, settling in London. He was an active member of Polish emigree circles, in 1958 founding the \"Association of Polish Philatelists\" in Great Britain. On May 26, 1978, Berek was named chairman of Supreme Audit Office in Exile, replacing W\u0142adys\u0142aw Zaleski. On May 15, following the decision of President in Exile Edward Raczy\u0144ski, Berek became Minister of Military Affairs in the government of Prime Minister Kazimierz Sabbat. In 1983, Berek was promoted to Genera\u0142 brygady. \n\nJan Berek died on June 18, 1986 in London.

village dates back to the 16th century and has about 300 well-preserved buildings that stem mainly from the 19th century when S\u00f8nderho was the leading navigation area on the Jutlandic west coast. Almost all the cottages, stand with their petite thatched house ends to the east and west surrounded by small gardens. Between the houses is a labyrinthine network of narrow paths and crooked streets. This is quite different from a hundred years ago, when there were only a few weather-beaten trees. The village is well protected from wind and water behind large sand dunes and green dikes. It has throughout history been connected to sea travel, but today the attractions are primarily the beaches (including the naturist) and the area's nature. There are shops, artisans, art galleries, caf\u00e9s and restaurants and of course S\u00f8nderho Kro, one of the oldest guesthouses in Denmark, from 1722. Nearby in Nordby there was an artist colony from same time as Skagen. This is reflected most clearly at the Fan\u00f8 Art Museum, which is located in the village.\n\nThe main street of the village is Landevejen. It has been renovated with cobblestone gutters finished with grass and cobblestones leading up to the cottage fences. These practical, traffic-calming measures are an attempt to reduce wheeled traffic in the village, so visitors and holidaymakers can enjoy the village on foot. To finish the urban embellishment the local authorities have granted new traditional street lights and signposts to make everything appear beautiful and harmonious.\n\nModern houses and buildings retain much the local character of the traditional Fan\u00f8 cottages but more and more are being used as summer residences which makes it difficult to maintain the number of inhabitants in a way that the village will stay a living community. Due to modern technology it is possible to settle in S\u00f8nderho and still have a working life that reaches beyond the island. The latest initiative in order to preserve a living community is the daycare center, Bakskuld. The old Sonderho Harbour and the navigational mark \"Kaaver\" will soon be added to Sonderho, see www.sonderhohavn.dk.\n\nTourism is still the main basis for the existence of the village and because of that, its shops, restaurants, bank and library are able to stay open all year. The village has a lifeboat station a volunteer fire brigade a central antenne system with cable TV and Internet and even its own vicar who resides in the beautiful vicarage."}, "entities": {"gpt":

Typically, the proportion of ingredients (by weight) is 65%, 70%, 75% or 80% tetryl to 35%, 30%, 25% or 20% TNT. Tetryl and TNT do form an eutectic with a setting point of 67.5 \u00b0C, which consists of 55% tetryl and 45% TNT. Hence, cast tetrytol charges consist of solidified suspensions of crystalline tetryl in the solid tetryl-TNT-eutectic. Tetrytol is more sensitive than TNT and less sensitive than tetryl to impact. The detonation velocity of unconfined cast cylindrical charges (1 inch diameter) of tetrytol is between 7290 and 7410\u00a0m/s with an average of 7350\u00a0m/s for tetrytol 75/25 and 7340 m/s for tetrytol 65/35. For comparison, cylindrical charges of cast pure TNT of similar dimensions are reported to detonate with a velocity of between 6680 and 6990 m/s.\nApplications of tetrytol are usually military in nature e.g. burster tubes for chemical weapons (e.g. nerve agent shells), blocks of demolition explosives and cast shaped charges.\n\nDry tetrytol is compatible with copper, brass, aluminum, magnesium, stainless steel, mild steel coated with acid proof paint and mild steel plated with copper, cadmium, zinc or nickel. Magnesium-aluminum alloys are slightly affected by dry tetrytol. Wet tetrytol is compatible with stainless steel and mild steel coated with acid proof black paint. Copper, brass, aluminum, magnesium, magnesium-aluminum alloy, mild steel and mild steel plated with cadmium, copper, zinc or nickel are slightly affected by wet tetrytol.\n\nWhen stored below 65\u00a0\u00b0C (149\u00a0\u00b0F) Tetrytol does not change stability, acid content, sensitivity or brisance. However, temperatures at 65\u00a0\u00b0C or above will allow the formation of an oily extrudate and distortion of blocks. Although tetryl undergoes partial decomposition on melting, the melting of tetrytol does not have the same effect. Even when Tetrytol is melted and solidified numerous times it causes no change in freezing point, sensitivity to impact or 100\u00a0\u00b0C vacuum stability test value.\n\nNote: Tetrytol has been discontinued by the U.S. due to the exudation and low stability at elevated storage temperatures."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Tetrytol", "description": "A high explosive composed of a mixture

He married the revolutionary Olga Bancic, and the couple began life together as members of the banned Romanian Communist Party, alternately entering and escaping prison. They went into exile in France, where in 1939 Olga gave birth to a daughter, Dolores. After the surrender of Paris during the World War II Battle of France, Jar entered the French Resistance, while his wife was captured by the Nazis and beheaded. He returned to Romania in 1943. Jar recalled his wartime experience in the poems of the 1945 collection \"S\u00e2nge \u0219i vis\" ('Blood and dream') and in the 1948 short story book \"Interogatoriu\".\n\nAfter the King Michael Coup of 1944, he occupied various administrative positions in what would soon become the Romanian Writers' Union. He made his literary debut in 1930 in \"Bluze albastre\" magazine. Other publications that ran his work include \"Cuv\u00e2ntul liber\", \"\u0218antier\", \"Vremea\", \"Tinere\u021bea\" and \"Flac\u0103ra\". Following two further poetry volumes that appeared in 1946 (\"Poemul marii de\u0219tept\u0103ri\" and \"Fragment de veac\"), he worked on prose. Jar turned out a large number of novels (\"Evadare\", 1949; \"Sf\u00e2r\u0219itul jalbelor\", 1950; \"La borna 202\", 1951; \"Marea preg\u0103tire\", 1952; \"Undeva pe Dun\u0103re\", 1952; \"O poveste simpl\u0103\", 1955; \"Lagard cel \u00eensemnat\", 1966; \"Tr\u0103darea lunii\", 1968; \"Eu, Consula!\", 1971), as well as a few short story volumes, such as \"Tehnicul \u0219i-a f\u0103cut datoria\" (1951) and \"Nasul \u0219i fericirea lumii\" (1976). He was barred from publishing between 1956 and 1966, due to a less rigid approach he had taken that set off vehement criticism and \"unmasking\".

She bore the titles \"King's Daughter\" and \"King's Wife.\" She might have been identical with Takhat, a daughter of Ramesses II, who is mentioned on a Louvre ostracon. Thus she was the aunt of Seti II, but since she was among the youngest children of Ramesses, it is very likely that she was the same age or even younger than Seti II who was the grandson of Ramesses. It is also possible that she was a grandchild of Ramesses; there are several examples of granddaughters bearing the title \"King's Daughter,\" although it was not very common. The king she married was either Merenptah or Seti II.\n\nShe is shown on several statues of Amenmesse, among them on two statues in the Karnak temple. On one of these, which still stands in Karnak, she is called \"King's Daughter, King's Wife (Takhat)\" and the word \"wife\" replaced the original \"mother\". According to Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton, the title was recarved when Seti, the rightful heir regained the throne and usurped the statue, and that it proves either that Takhat married Seti when he became pharaoh, or that they had been married before, which means Amenmesse was Seti's son and usurped the throne from his own father. This theory might be strengthened by the other statue (now in Cairo), on which Takhat is also named as \"King's Daughter\" and \"King's Wife,\" but without any trace of recarving, while the king's name replaced another name. This statue was, according to Dodson and Hilton, possibly made by Seti; later it was usurped by Amenmesse who replaced Seti's name with his own, while leaving his mother's titles intact; still later Amenmesse's name was again replaced with that of Seti. According to another theory Seti was never married to Takhat and had her original titles recarved only to remove all traces that her son ever ruled.\n\nShe is likely to have been buried in Amenmesse's tomb KV10 in the Valley of the Kings. Her sarcophagus lid originally belonged to an otherwise unknown Princess-Queen Anuketemheb, who might be identical with a daughter of Ramesses II, a princess once named in the Luxor temple but from whose name only \"...heb\" remains. The tomb was later usurped by two family members of Ramesses IX: his mother Takhat and his Great Royal Wife Baketwerel. The latter was once thought to be Amenmesse's Great Royal Wife, but it has been proven since then that decoration mentioned her replaced that of Amenmesse in the tomb, so she must have lived later."},

presented by the Academia Mexicana de Artes y Ciencias Cinematogr\u00e1ficas (AMACC) in Mexico. It is given in honor of an actor who has delivered an outstanding performance in a leading role while working within the Mexican film industry. In 1947, the 1st and 2nd Ariel Awards were held, with Domingo Soler and David Silva winning for the films \"La Barraca\" and \"Campe\u00f3n Sin Corona\", respectively. With the exception of the years 1959 to 1971, when the Ariel Awards were suspended, the award has been given annually. Nominees and winners are determined by a committee formed every year consisting of academy members (active and honorary), previous winners and individuals with at least two Ariel nominations; the committee members submit their votes through the official AMACC website.\n\nSince its inception, the award has been given to 48 actors. Dami\u00e1n Alc\u00e1zar has received the most awards in this category with five Ariels and also is the most nominated performer with eight nominations; Arturo de C\u00f3rdova and Pedro Infante follow with seven nominations each. Actors Pedro Armend\u00e1riz and Pedro Armend\u00e1riz, Jr., father and son, also won the award for Best Actor. In 1972, Alfonso Arau won for his self-directed leading role in \"El \u00c1guila Descalza\". Spanish actor Javier Bardem was nominated in 2011 for his performance in \"Biutiful\", for which he was also nominated for the Academy Award and a BAFTA Award, and won the Goya and the Prix d'interpr\u00e9tation masculine at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nSix films have featured two nominated performances for Best Actor, \"De Todos Modos Juan Te Llamas\" (Jorge Russek and Juan Ferrara), \"Cuartelazo\" (H\u00e9ctor Ortega and Bruno Rey), \"Vidas Errantes\" (Jos\u00e9 Carlos Ruiz and Ignacio Guadalupe), \"Chido Guan, El Tacos de Oro\" (Fernando Arau and Mario Almada), \"Dulces Compa\u00f1\u00edas\" (Roberto Cobo and Ramiro Huerta), and \"600 Millas\" (Kristyan Ferrer and Tim Roth); Russek and Ruiz won the award. As of the 2020 ceremony, Luis Alberti is the most recent winner for his role in the film \"Mano de Obra\"."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Ariel Award for Best Actor", "description": "An award

Grimm), is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created in 2003 by writer Brian K. Vaughan and artist Adrian Alphona, the character debuted in \"Runaways\" vol. 1 #1 (July 2003). Like every member of the original Runaways, Nico is the daughter of the super-powered villains calling themselves \"the Pride\"; in her case, she is the daughter of dark wizards. Upon finding out, Nico runs away with the rest of the runaways but later discovers that she inherited her parents' magical aptitude. Whenever Nico bleeds, a powerful staff emerges from her chest, called the Staff of One, allowing Nico to bend magic.\n\nAfter the Runaways are betrayed by one of their own in volume one, Nico reluctantly becomes the de facto leader of her unofficial and nameless superhero team, making her one of the few Japanese-American superheroine team leaders. Nico's trademark is her elaborate and ornate Gothic wardrobe. Nico is a sorceress like her parents and great-grandmother before her and can cast nearly any spell imaginable with her staff. Nico uses her talents to make up for her parents' villainous actions and to prevent anyone from assuming the Pride's place at the top of Los Angeles organized crime.\n\nIn the Marvel Universe, she was featured in \"Avengers Arena\" and its sequel, \"Avengers Undercover\", where it follows the survivors of the thirty day-long deathmatch in MurderWorld. Nico is traumatized by those events and temporarily walked away from the Runaways. She later joined Marvel's first all-female Avengers team, \"A-Force\".\n\nNico's Staff of One responds to verbal commands, but can only respond to any given spell once. If she attempts to cast the same spell twice, the results have unforeseen consequences. To summon the Staff itself, Nico must bleed\u2014as all magic comes with a cost. After working with the Witchbreaker, Nico develops the ability to cast spells without the Staff and upgrades her own abilities. In the wake of her resurrection in Murderworld, Nico jumps up to another power level and even receives a magical arm replacement that can channel supernatural energies more powerful than the Staff. By the relaunch of \"Runaways\" volume five, Nico's Staff and powers are reverted to its original condition and her magical arm replaced with a normal arm for reasons unknown yet.\n\nNico Minoru was portrayed by Lyrica Okano in the Hulu television series \"Runaways\" which is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Nico Minoru", "description": "A fictional superheroine in Marvel Comics.", "types": ["Superhero", "Fictional character", "Sorceress"]}, {"label": "Sister Grimm", "description": "A former name of Nico Minoru in Marvel Comics.", "types": ["Fictional character", "Superheroine"]}, {"label": "Marvel Comics", "description": "A publisher of American comic books and related media.", "types": ["Publisher", "Entertainment"]}, {"label": "Runaways", "description": "A comic book series published by Marvel Comics.", "types": ["Comic book", "Fiction"]}, {"label": "Brian K.

He lives in Burton Joyce.\n\nHe enjoyed considerable success as a player, making his Notts County debut in their 1984\u201385 Second Division campaign which ended in relegation. He was a regular first team player from 1985\u201386 onwards, helping them win promotion back to the Second Division in 1990 and to the First Division a year later (both through the playoffs). However, a serious knee injury in February 1992 ruled him out for the next two years and meant that County were without him when they needed him most\u00a0\u2014 during the final quarter of the 1991\u201392 season when they battled against relegation from the First Division. The relegation battle was lost, and he managed just one appearance in the 1993\u201394 season as he made his comeback from injury.\n\nHe was fully fit for the 1994\u201395 season, but his presence in the team wasn't enough to prevent a relegation battle which was ultimately lost.\n\nBy the time County went down from Division One (as the old Second Division became known following the creation of the FA Premier League for the 1992\u201393 season), Yates had transferred to their local rivals Derby County - a \u00a3350,000 fee taking him to the Baseball Ground on 26 January 1995. He had played 314 league games in 10 years for Notts County.\n\nThe Rams had been favourites for promotion every season since their relegation from the top flight in 1991, but the closest they had come to achieving Premier League status was playoff defeats in 1992 and 1994, and when Yates arrived the playoffs were looking beyond their reach. They could only manage a ninth-place finish in 1994\u201395, but they achieved automatic promotion the following season as Yates's contributed 38 league appearances and two goals. However, the arrival of Igor Stimac restricted Yates to just 10 appearances in 1996\u201397 and nine the following season as Derby established themselves as a consistent mid table Premier League side.\n\nHe departed to Watford, newly promoted to Division One as Division Two champions, on 16 July 1998 on a free transfer. However, injury problems restricted his first team opportunities at Vicarage Road and he played just 12 games, scoring once against Bristol City, in the 1998\u201399 season. Watford won a second successive promotion via the playoffs and reached the Premier League, but Yates did not feature in the 1999\u20132000 campaign as Watford were relegated.

Parliament from Aust-Agder in 1965, and was re-elected on four occasions. He had previously served as a deputy representative during the terms 1958\u20131961 and 1961\u20131965.\n\nOn the local level he was a member of Bygland municipal council from 1951 to 1975, serving as deputy mayor from 1962 to 1963 and mayor from 1958 to 1959 and 1963 to 1966. From 1958 to 1960 he was also a member of Aust-Agder county council. He chaired the local party chapter from 1951 to 1964, and from 1965 to 1966 he was a member of the Labour Party national board.\n\nDuring the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Faremo was a member of the resistance group Milorg. He was captured on 5 February 1943 and imprisoned in German and Austrian Nacht und Nebel camps. He escaped in 1945, helped by the White Buses. Among his awards for war efforts were the \"Honorary Medal of the German Democratic Republic\", 1970.\n\nFaremo was later a promoter of Norwegian-Yugoslav relations and a member of the council of the Norwegian branch of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights from 1985 to 1988. He was active in the Norwegian branch of the European Movement, in the Norwegian Defence Association, and founded a branch of Noregs M\u00e5llag intended for members of parliament, named \"L\u00f8vebakken m\u00e5llag\". He chaired the latter group from 1978 to 1985.\nHe chaired the friendship association Friends of Israel in the Norwegian Labour Movement (Norwegian: Venner av Israel i Norsk Arbeiderbevegelse).\n\nOther than his military training, Faremo was educated in the Norwegian State Railways and spent large parts of his professional career there. From 1964 he worked with promoting tourism in the Setesdal region.\n\nOsmund Faremo was married to Tora, n\u00e9e Aamlid. One of their daughters Grete Faremo followed in his footsteps to become a politician for the Labour Party. Grete Faremo served as a member of parliament and government minister before turning to the private sector to become a CEO."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Osmund Faremo", "description": "Norwegian

Britain. He served in the RAF as part of No. 609 Squadron West Riding of Yorkshire Squadron RAF. He was killed in action on 15 September 1940. Gaunt was from a well-known textile family and screen star James Mason was a cousin. He was buried in his family plot at Salendine Nook Baptist Church with his grandparents and later his father was also buried there in 1958. He was good friends with David Moore Crook.\n\nGeoffrey Norman Gaunt served with 609 Squadron Auxiliary Air Force before the war and received some flying training with the unit. He was commissioned into the Auxiliary Air Force in April 1940 and completed his training at the Flying Training School at Cranwell, Lincolnshire in June and July 1940. Gaunt then went to 7 Operational Training Unit at Hawarden, near RAF Sealand, in the North Wales-Chester area. After converting to Spitfire Mark Ones there, Geoffrey Gaunt rejoined 609 Spitfire Squadron on 16 August 1940 at Warmwell in Dorset, close to Weymouth, for the protection of Portland Naval Base and places from Bristol, Somerset, Dorset, Devon, and Cornwall.\n\nEarlier, in May 1940 609 West Riding squadron flew sorties in support of Operation Dynamo - the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk during the Battle of France. One-third of the squadron's pilots were lost during a three-day period.\n\nIn the Battle of Britain, which started in July 1940, the squadron operated from Middle Wallop, with half the squadron operating from the forward base at Warmwell in Dorset. During August 1940, the squadron destroyed 46 enemy aircraft but nearly all the pre-war auxiliary pilots were lost, either killed or missing. In October 1940, 609 became the first squadron to achieve 100 confirmed aerial victories.\n\nGeoffrey Gaunt had rejoined 609 Squadron on 16 August and got into many combats through the month. He shared in the destruction of a Messerschmitt BF110 fighter on 25 August which was shared Destroyed with P/O Noel Agazarian, who was later a Battle of Britain fighter ace.\n\nGeoffrey Gaunt was killed on 15 September 1940 when he was shot down during an attack on German bombers over London. His Spitfire, R6690, crashed and burned out near Kenley. This day was later known as \"Battle of Britain Day\" as the continued strength of the RAF fighter defence decided Hitler to postpone and then cancel his planned invasion of Britain.\n\nDavid Crook wrote a book titled Spitfire Pilot, published by Faber and Faber in 1942, which describes his friends including Geoffrey Gaunt who were killed, one by one as the Battle of Britain carried on through 1940. The book immortalizes these men and Crook also, for he was to die along with his friends in wartime. These included: Geoffrey Gaunt, Noel Agazarian, John Dundas, and Phillip \"Pip\" Barran.\n\n# A Spitfire flown by \"Aggy\" Agazarian and pilots including David More Crook, John Dundas, (also killed, like Agazarian and Crook in wartime) hangs today in the Imperial War Museum at Lambeth, London.\n\n# A Memorial Hut to 609 West Riding squadron, complete with a replica Spitfire, a series of wartime portraits of these pilots, relics and memorabilia is at Elvington Airfield for the Yorkshire Air Museum, near York, in tribute to these men like Geoffrey Gaunt who were killed in wartime."},

The individual house plots are arranged along a village street and have strips of farmland adjacent to the dwelling. It is a type of linear village.\n\nThe farmsteads of these rural settlement types are strictly linear, because they run alongside a track or a small or larger watercourse. They can be viewed as one half of an \"Angerdorf\" or small \"Stra\u00dfendorf\" that has been bisected longitudinally.\n\nThe \"Zeilendorf\" differs from the \"Reihendorf\" or \"Hufend\u00f6rfer\" mainly because of its regularity and the close proximity of adjacent dwellings as well as its generally small size.\n\nWhether front gardens are laid in front of the row of houses in a \"Zeilendorf\", depends on regional tradition. Many narrow \"Zeilend\u00f6rfer\" could develop into an \"Angerdorf\" through further building (e.\u00a0g. Jetzles near Vitis) or into a larger \"Reihendorf\" (e.\u00a0g. Kirchschlag near Linz). If the single line of settlement at the heart of the settlement was extended on the other side of the river or stream, the strips of land belonging to the farms would face one another on either side of the village street.\n\nIf the elongated arable fields behind a single- or two-row village had a width of less than about 10 metres (which often used to happen as a result of inheritance division), they are known in the Upper German language area as \"Streifenparzellen\" (\"strip plots\") or \"Riemenparzellen\" (\"belt plots\"). Through combining plots and land amelioration more economically viable plots of land could be formed.\n\nRelatively elongated \"Zeilend\u00f6rfer\" often develop along rivers, whose frequently flooding required the construction of the village street immediately on the edge of the river terrace, where agriculture was in any case restricted to one side. Such an example is Spillern on the Danube (see 2nd external link), where the single row of houses was not expanded into two rows until recent decades when it became a \"Stra\u00dfendorf\". A saying from earlier times is that in Spillern \"the geese are only fried on one side.\" \nThrough the construction of the railway embankment in 1841, the side facing the river was made flood-proof and the former back doors (\"Hintauswege\") now face the country road built soon after the construction of the railway, whilst on the river side, a branch of the Danube silted up."}, "entities":

Ryan", "text": "Donald P. Ryan (born 1957) is an American archaeologist, Egyptologist, writer and a member of the Division of Humanities at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington. His areas of research interest include Egyptian archaeology, Polynesian archaeology, the history of archaeology, the history of exploration, ancient languages and scripts and experimental archaeology. He is best known for his research in Egypt including excavations in the Valley of the Kings where he investigated the long-neglected undecorated tombs in the royal cemetery. His work there resulted in the rediscovery of the lost and controversial tomb KV60, the re-opening of the long-buried KV21 with its two female and likely royal occupants, and tombs KV27, KV28, KV44, KV45 and KV48. In 2017, he rediscovered three small tombs (KV50, KV51 and KV52) in the Valley of the Kings which when first encountered in 1906 contained the mummies of animals including a dog and monkeys.\n\nThe mummy found within KV60 was identified as that of the female pharaoh Hatshepsut by Zahi Hawass and his Egyptian team in 2007.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2002, Ryan worked closely with the Norwegian explorer, archaeologist and writer Thor Heyerdahl (1914-2002). Among their many projects, the two directed excavations at the site of the Pyramids of Guimar on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. Ryan has been entrusted with continuing some of the research aspects of Heyerdahl\u2019s legacy.\n\nOther research by Ryan includes investigations of ancient Egyptian cordage and other technologies, studies of inscribed Egyptian funerary cones, \nbiographical studies of early archaeologists including Giovanni Belzoni, studies of the influence of antiquity on culture and the arts, and the documentation of petroglyphs on the island of Hawaii.\n\nAs a writer and researcher, Ryan is the author of numerous scientific and popular articles on archaeological subjects. His books include volumes in the popular \"Complete Idiot\u2019s Guide\" Series (\"Lost Civilizations\", \"Biblical Mysteries\", \"Ancient Egypt\" and \"World of the Bible\"), \"A Shattered Visage Lies...Nineteenth Century Poetry Inspired By Ancient Egypt\", \"Ancient Egypt on Five Deben a Day\", \"Ancient Egypt: The Basics\", \"Ancient Egypt in Verse\", and a memoir, \"Beneath the Sands of Egypt\". He was a major contributor to \"Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki in New Light\" and wrote the introduction to the new Norwegian edition of Heyerdahl's \"Kon-Tiki\". His television credits include \"The Face of Tutankhamun\" (BBC-Television/A&E), \"Biography: Howard Carter\" (A&E), \"Great Builders of Egypt\" (A&E), \"Missing Mummies\" (Learning Channel), \"Ancient Mysteries of the World: Easter Island\" (PAX Network),\"Secrets of Egypt's Lost Queen\" (Discovery Channel), Nordisk Film,\"P\u00e5 jakt etter paradiset.\" (Advisor), \"Terra X: Thor Heyerdahl (Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen), \"Unearthed: Tut's Buried Secrets.\" (Science Channel).\n\nRyan is a Fellow of The Explorers Club and the Royal Geographical Society, a Research Associate of the Kon-Tiki Museum, a founding member of the Scientific Committee of the \"Foundation for Exploration and Research on Cultural Origins\", a mountaineering instructor, long-distance runner, and pianist."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Donald P.

Founded in 1764 as the \"College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations\", it is the seventh-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.\nAt its foundation, Brown was the first college in the U.S. to accept students regardless of their religious affiliation. Its engineering program was established in 1847, making it the oldest in the Ivy League. The university was one of the early doctoral-granting U.S. institutions in the late 19th century, adding masters and doctoral studies in 1887. In 1969, Brown adopted a New Curriculum sometimes referred to as the Brown Curriculum after a period of student lobbying. The New Curriculum eliminated mandatory \"general education\" distribution requirements, made students \"the architects of their own syllabus\" and allowed them to take any course for a grade of satisfactory (Pass) or no-credit (Fail) which is unrecorded on external transcripts. In 1971, Brown's coordinate women's institution, Pembroke College, was fully merged into the university; Pembroke Campus now includes dormitories and classrooms used by all of Brown.\n\nAdmissions is among the most selective in the United States, with an acceptance rate of about 7% for Fall 2019.\n\nThe university comprises the College, the Graduate School, Alpert Medical School, the School of Engineering, the School of Public Health and the School of Professional Studies (which includes the IE Brown Executive MBA program). Brown's international programs are organized through the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, and the university is academically affiliated with the Marine Biological Laboratory and the Rhode Island School of Design. The Brown/RISD Dual Degree Program, offered in conjunction with the Rhode Island School of Design, is a five-year course that awards degrees from both institutions.\n\nBrown's main campus is located in the College Hill neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island. The university's neighborhood is a federally listed architectural district with a dense concentration of Colonial-era buildings. Benefit Street, on the western edge of the campus, contains \"one of the finest cohesive collections of restored seventeenth- and eighteenth-century architecture in the United States\".\n\n, 8 Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with Brown University as alumni, faculty, or researchers, as well as five National Humanities Medalists and 10 National Medal of Science laureates. Other notable alumni include 24 Pulitzer Prize winners, eight billionaire graduates, one U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice, four U.S. Secretaries of State, 54 members of the United States Congress, 57 Rhodes Scholars, 52 Gates Cambridge Scholars, 50 Marshall Scholars, and 14 MacArthur Genius Fellows."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Brown University", "description": "A private Ivy League research

The \"operands\" of the product are types, and the structure of a product type is determined by the fixed order of the operands in the product. An instance of a product type retains the fixed order, but otherwise may contain all possible instances of its primitive data types. The expression of an instance of a product type will be a tuple, and is called a \"tuple type\" of expression. A product of types is a direct product of two or more types.\n\nIf there are only two component types, it can be called a \"pair type\". For example, if two component types A and B are the set of all possible values of that type, the product type written A \u00d7 B contains elements that are pairs (a,b), where \"a\" and \"b\" are instances of A and B respectively. The pair type is a special case of the dependent pair type, where the type B may depend on the instance picked from A.\n\nIn many languages, product types take the form of a record type, for which the components of a tuple can be accessed by label. In languages that have algebraic data types, as in most functional programming languages, algebraic data types with one constructor are isomorphic to a product type.\n\nIn the Curry\u2013Howard correspondence, product types are associated with logical conjunction (AND) in logic.\n\nThe notion directly extends to the product of an arbitrary finite number of types (a n-ary product type), and in this case, it characterizes the expressions which behave as tuples of expressions of the corresponding types. A degenerated form of product type is the unit type: it is the product of no types.\n\nIn call-by-value programming languages, a product type can be interpreted as a set of pairs whose first component is a value in the first type and whose second component is a value in the second type. In short, it is a cartesian product and it corresponds to a product in the category of types.\n\nMost functional programming languages have a primitive notion of product type. For instance, the product of \"type1\", ..., \"typen\" is written \"type1\"codice_1...codice_1\"typen\" in ML and codice_3\"type1\"codice_4...codice_4\"typen\"codice_6 in Haskell. In both these languages, tuples are written codice_3\"v1\"codice_4...codice_4\"vn\"codice_6 and the components of a tuple are extracted by pattern-matching. Additionally, many functional programming languages provide more general algebraic data types, which extend both product and sum types.

After the death of his father in 1837, he moved with his mother to her home town of Providence, Rhode Island. Mason graduated with honors from Brown University in 1850 and was recommended for the bar shortly after. Following the establishment of Washington Territory in March 1853, Mason was appointed Secretary of the Territory and came west, arriving in September 1853.\n\nAs Acting Governor he served the state in time of war, from October 1855 to January 1856, as hostilities between settlers and First Nations peoples erupted in Snohomish, King, Pierce, and Thurston counties. Historians assess his efforts during this time as \"marked with energy, decision, and wisdom.\" Mason called for volunteers, maintained peaceful relations with non-hostile bands, and treated all parties with fairness. From May 15, 1855, Mason assisted Stevens in the negotiations of the Medicine Creek and Point No Point Treaties and was credited as the secretary of the treaty commissions. Mason transported documents to the nation's capital and secured $300,000 for territorial aid.\n\nIn all he served four stints as acting Governor:\n\n# March 26, 1854 \u2013 December 1854\n# May 12, 1855 \u2013 January 19, 1856: Gov. Stevens was in eastern Washington to establish treaties.\n# August 1857 \u2013 September 1857: Gov. Stevens resigned to become the delegate in Congress for Washington Territory. Mason acted as governor until Gov. Fayette McMullen arrived.\n# August 1858 \u2013 July 1859: Gov. McMullen was removed from office. Mason acted as governor until Gov. Richard D. Gholson arrived.\n\nMason died after a brief illness at Olympia, Washington Territory. Isaac Stevens gave his eulogy at the funeral. His burial location was established by the Washington state Archivist from the primary source material and his grave marked in 1997 following an extensive search.\n\nMason County, Washington was renamed in 1864 in his honor.

This gathering was called \"The New Corn Ceremony\" or \"Green Corn Festival.\" The present day \"Choctaw Indian Fair\" has roots in this ancient celebration.\n\nThe Fair has long been a time for Choctaws to gather and pay homage to their traditions and heritage but it has also emerged as an opportunity for the Tribe to welcome visitors to the reservation and share their way of life. \n\nChoctaw ancestors have left behind a rich legacy that includes:\n\n* basketry\n* beadwork\n* clothing\n* dancing\n* drumming\n* foods\n* hunting\n* language\n* legends\n* pottery\n* quilting\n* stickball (Native American)\n* striking sticks\n\nEven though the Fair has been around for many years, the Mississippi Choctaw say that the fair began to evolve into the Annual Fair it has become in 1949. The Choctaw Princess Pageant was not added to the fair until 1955 when Patsy Sam (Buffington) was crowned as the first Choctaw Princess.\n\nNashville-style country music became part of the Choctaw Indian Fair in the 1960s when Nashville stars such as Chet Atkins, Connie Smith, Lester Flatt, Mac Wiseman, Jerry Reed, Johnny Gimble, Pig Robbins, and Merle Travis noticed what the Choctaws were doing with their Annual Fair. Each of these performers performed for free at the fair as a tribute to the Choctaw Nation and in support of the fair. In the 1970s, paid performers were added to the Fair and now the last three nights of the Fair include paid country music performers.\n\nAnother important element of the annual fair has been a reemergence of the traditional dances of the Choctaw. In the 1970s, an effort began to revive many of the traditional dances of the Choctaw that were no longer being danced. Because of the renewed interest in traditional dance brought about by the Annual Fair, each morning and afternoon dance groups from different communities perform for fairgoers. Many of the dance groups now make paid appearances outside the reservation. The Choctaw dance performed at the Annual Fair is seen as an authentic expression of the ancient Choctaw traditional culture and gives people who attend the fair a glimpse into that culture.\n\nAlong with music and dance, many Choctaw artists display their bead work, baskets, drums, and other art during the Fair. At many of the artists' tables, fairgoers will see the skills of the artist being passed down traditionally as there will be two or three generations of the same family working on projects.\n\nThe 2021 Choctaw Indian Fair will take place 14\u201317 July, as the COVID-19 pandemic caused 2020's cancellation."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Mississippi Choctaws", "description": "A Native

It is often described as the original version of the Dutch Constitution that is still in force today. Under pressure from the Revolutions of 1848 in surrounding countries, King William II agreed to several demands of the liberal parliamentary opposition. The House of Representatives obtained much more influence, and was now directly elected (although still by a restricted group of voters within a system of single-winner electoral districts). The reform was in some sense a peaceful revolution, in which liberal politician Johan Rudolph Thorbecke and King William II played important roles.\n\nOn 17 March 1848, the king appointed a state commission composed by Johan Rudolph Thorbecke (leader), Dirk Donker Curtius, Jacobus Matthe\u00fcs de Kempenaer, Lodewijk Caspar Luzac and Lambertus Dominicus Storm to prepare the Constitutional Reform, which was finished on 19 June. The commission's draft formed the basis of the government's proposals. The King and Minister Donker Curtius then made sure that the proposals were accepted by both houses of the States General, both of which still had a conservative majority. Agreement was reached on 11 October 1848. On 3 November 1848, the new Constitution was proclaimed.\n\nThe most important changes included:\n*The introduction of full ministerial responsibility, which meant the henceforth the Ministers were responsible for the government's policies instead of the king, who received sovereign immunity. \n*The States-Provincial, themselves elected by the voter, appointed by majorities for each province the members of the Senate from a select group of upper class citizens.\n*Parliament was henceforth elected directly, and obtained the right to interpellation, the right to hold investigative hearings (\"recht van enqu\u00eate\"), and the right to amend government bills.\n*Suffrage was enlarged (though still limited to census suffrage), as was the bill of rights with the freedom of assembly and freedom of association, the privacy of correspondence, freedom of ecclesiastical organisation and the freedom of education.\n\nThe freedom of ecclesiastical organisation enabled the Catholic Church to reestablish the episcopal hierarchy in the Netherlands in 1853 (the previous hierarchy had been abolished during the Eighty Years' War). This challenged the perceived notion of the Netherlands being a Protestant nation, but Prime Minister Thorbecke maintained that, based on the freedom of religion and separation of church and state, the Catholic Church was allowed to reorganise itself on Dutch territory. Conservative Protestants initiated the April Movement in an attempt to prevent it, winning the sympathy of King William III. This led to a constitutional crisis and the resignation of the Thorbecke cabinet, because the king had violated the new Constitution that prohibited his interference in political affairs, and the ministers had to take responsibility in his stead."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Constitutional Reform of 1848", "description": "The reform that laid the basis for the present system of

He began his professional music career when he wrote and recorded his first record at the age of eleven. A child prodigy, Wammack's first record was issued when he was twelve years old, and at 17 he hit the American charts with \"Scratchy\", an instrumental which peaked at #80 in 1964, although the record was released in mid 1962. Wammack got work recording at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, in the 1960s, and in 1975 released a solo album which generated two hits in the U.S. \"Easy Evil\" (#72; written by Alan O'Day), and \"(Shu-Doo-Pa-Poo-Poop) Love Being Your Fool\" (\"Billboard\" Hot 100 #38; written by Jerry Williams, Jr. and Charlie Whitehead.\n\nHe was Little Richard\u2019s band leader from 1984 until 1995. He wrote \"Greenwood, Mississippi\" which Richard recorded in 1970, featuring Wammack on lead guitar. In 1988, Richard recorded Wammack\u2019s \u201c(There's) No Place Like Home\u201c, planned as a new single, but shelved. It is featured on an Australian DVD of a 1989 concert, \u201cGiants of Rock and Roll\u201d. Still performing, Travis now works with Muscle Shoals Music Marketing, and has added record producer to his resume. He is a member of the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, and in 1999 Wammack received the Professional Musician Award from the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. In 2005, he was inducted into The Southern Legends Entertainment & Performing Arts Hall of Fame. In May 2006, Gibson Guitars presented Travis with a new Gibson ES-335 guitar as part of their documentary honoring legendary Gibson ES series players.\n\nWammack performed with Billy Lee Riley and with Sonny Burgess and the Legendary Pacers at Newport, Arkansas's annual \"Depot Days Festival\" on September 27, 2008. On August 30, 2009 at the Silver Moon in Newport, Arkansas, Wammack again played with Sonny Burgess and the Legendary Pacers, and with other bands, at the Billy Lee Riley benefit concert, which was held to defray expenses incurred by Riley's family due to his long and losing battle to cancer. Riley died on August 4, 2009. Wammack continued to frequently perform at the \"Depot Days Festival\", including on September 30, 2017."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Travis Wammack", "description": "American rock and roll

They used portable tents made of animal skins. Their subsistence activities were historically centred on hunting and trapping caribou, moose, deer, and small game.\n\nTheir language, Ilnu-Aimun or Innu-Aimun (popularly known since the French colonial era as \"Montagnais\"), is spoken throughout Nitassinan, with certain dialect differences. It is part of the Cree language group, and is unrelated to neighbouring Inuit languages.\n\nThe \"Innu / Ilnu\" actually consist of two regional tribal groups, which differ in dialect and partly also in their way of life and culture: \n* the Ilnu, Nehilaw or \"Western/Southern Montagnais\" in the south, speaking the \"l\"-dialect (Ilnu-Aimun or Nenueun/Ne\u02d0hlwe\u02d0u\u02d0n), and \n* the Innu or \"Eastern Montagnais\" (\"Central/Moisie Montagnais\", \"Eastern/Lower North Shore Montagnais\", and \"Labrador/North West River Montagnais\") living further north, speaking the \"n\"-dialect (Innu-Aimun) \nBoth groups are still called \"Montagnais\" in the official language of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Development Canada, on the other hand, the Naskapi (\"people beyond the horizon\", \u14c7\u1505\u1472\u1431), who live even further north, also call themselves Innu or Iyiyiw.\n\nIn 1999, Survival International published a study of the Innu communities of Labrador. It assessed the adverse effects of the Canadian government's relocating the people far from their ancestral lands and preventing them from practising their ancient way of life.\n\nToday, about 18,000 Innu live in eleven settlements within reserves in Qu\u00e9bec and Labrador. However, to avoid confusion with the Inuit, who belong to the Eskimo peoples, today only the singular form \"Innu / Ilnu\" is used and the correct plural form as \"Innut / Innuat / Ilnuatsh\" is dispensed with."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Innu / Ilnu", "description": "Indigenous inhabitants of Nitassinan, Canada, historically hunter-gatherers", "types": ["Indigenous people", "Canadian

In 1979, she opened Soundscape, the first multi-cultural performance space in New York City, on west 52nd Street which she directed for the next five years. Gillis, Soundscape and the music played there is the subject of a web based project by WKCR Radio 89.9 NY \n\nFrom 1984, Gillis worked on career development with international musicians including Youssou N'dour from Senegal, Yomo Toro from Puerto Rico; Salif Keita form Mali, and Carlinhos Brown from Brazil.\n\nGillis has been the subject of a number of press articles, with \"The New York Times\" describing her as \"the closest thing world music has to a doyenne\".\n\nIn 1996, she was hired as a consultant by the ICRC to accompany musicians on a trip to Angola, Liberia, Kenya and South African to witness first hand the results of ethnic cleansing. Gillis worked with the International Committee of the Red Cross to produce a CD.\n\nTwenty-five of Gillis' recordings have been released by Smithsonian Folkways and Lyrichord.\n\nAs well, there have been 9 releases on DIW of Live from Soundscape tapes made during the years that the performance space which was located at 500 West 52nd Street was open.\n\nIn 2000, she was nominated for a Grammy in the Producer category for the Archie Shepp/Roswell Rudd Quartet Live in New York, and again in 2001 for Roswell Rudd's MALIcool.\n\nShe has performed \"sit down comedy\" \u2013 and has a One Older Woman show \"Tales from Gerriassic Park- On the Verge of Extinction\".

The railroad built a station, a warehouse and a store, and a town grew, as with the adjacent stops at Marshall and The Plains. As Delaplane prospered, the previously prosperous town of Paris on the Dumfries-Winchester Road (Virginia Route 17), lagged. The town's name was changed in 1874 to honor its postmaster and owner of the general store, Washington E. Delapane.\n\nThe historic district today looks much like in 1861, when troops embarked en route to the First Battle of Bull Run, although that conflict (and troop movements of Union and Confederate Forces, including Mosby's Rangers) devastated the area. The surrounding area is part of the Commonwealth of Virginia's Mosby Heritage area, the first such heritage area and designated in order to draw attention to the historic, natural and cultural resources in this section of Northern Virginia. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. It is included in the larger Crooked Run Valley Rural Historic District (at its southern end) also designated that year.\n\nIt includes 24 contributing buildings and 3 contributing sites in Delaplane. Several residential and commercial buildings date from the mid-19th century; other dwellings and business date from the late-19th- and ear1y-20th century dwellings and some commercial structures. Notable buildings include two vernacular Greek Revival style, two-story, brick structures that were used as stores, stations, and warehouses (1852); Roger's Depot; the Delaplane House (c. 1852); the old Shacklett's Mill (c. 1910); the old Delaplane Store (Turner Seaton's Store and Shacklett's store) that now houses the post office; and the McDonald House. The Westminster Presbyterian Church (now converted into a home) lies in this historic district, but the current town's two historic churches both lie slightly outside the limits of this historic district, although within the Crooked Run Valley historic district: Emmanuel Episcopal Church (Delaplane) (on Route 17; founded 1850 and used as a hospital by both Union and Confederate troops) and Pleasant Vale Baptist Church (at the intersection of route 724 and 826, built 1845)."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Delaplane Historic District", "description": "A national historic district located in Delaplane, Fauquier County, Virginia.", "types": ["Historic district", "National Register of Historic Places", "Mosby Heritage area"]}, {"label": "Piedmont Station", "description": "A train station built by the Manassas Gap Railroad in Delaplane, Virginia.", "types": ["Train station", "Manassas Gap Railroad"]}, {"label": "Manassas Gap Railroad", "description": "A railroad that linked the Alexandria and Orange Railroad with the line running into the Shenandoah valley at Manassas.", "types": ["Railroad"]}, {"label": "Marshall", "description": "A town adjacent to Delaplane that grew around a train station.", "types": ["Town"]}, {"label": "The Plains", "description": "A town adjacent to Delaplane that grew around a train station.", "types": ["Town"]}, {"label": "Paris", "description": "A town on the Dumfries-Winchester Road that lagged behind Delaplane in prosperity.", "types": ["Town"]}, {"label": "Washington E.

She is known for her landscape painting, and her works are held by Glasgow's main public galleries.\n\nDownie was born in North Carolina in 1958, to a Scottish father and English mother. She came to Scotland with her family when she was seven. She studied art in Aberdeen, and worked in several countries thereafter, including the United States and Holland, but is based in Edinburgh and known for her works portraying the Scottish landscape. Downie works in a range of media, including oil and acrylic painting, ink painting, collage, and lithography\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006, Downie was President of the Society of Scottish Artists. In 2005 she was shortlisted for the Jerwood Drawing Prize. In the late 2000s, she created Coast Road Diaries, documenting a two-year journey around Scotland; the works formed a travelling exhibition that was critically acclaimed.\n\nA member of the Royal Scottish Academy, in 2010 she travelled to China to study ink painting, returning in 2011 and again in 2013. Works resulting from these residencies were displayed at the Royal Scottish Academy and at the Royal Glasgow Institute's Kelly Gallery. In 2014, Downie was commissioned as an artist-in-residence at the Forth Road Bridge, to create an exhibition and work to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the bridge's construction. She described her role as conducting \"an in-depth interview\" with the structure, in order to gather the information and ideas to inform her work. She also climbed to the top of the structure, and spent two months working in an improvised studio directly under the bridge.\n\nDescribed by journalist Jan Patience as \"sure, deft and fearless\", examples of Downie's art are held in the Glasgow Museums, including figurative works, such as \"12 Minute Baby\" (1993) and urban landscapes such as \"Blue Night, Yellow Roof\" (1991).\n\nIn late September 2014 Downie set off for 3 months of travel in Australia and Japan, carrying out research of river systems, estuaries and bridges on the edge of the western Pacific Ocean. This culminated in a 2nd major solo exhibition with the Scottish Gallery \"Estuary\" in Edinburgh in April 2015. That same month also featured a two-person show \u2018Drawing on the Landscape\u2019 at Cobalt Contemporary in Pittenweem. Both shows were reviewed by the Times, The Scotsman and Studio International."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Kate Downie", "description": "Scottish artist known for landscape painting", "types":

Shapiro holds an A.B. degree in physics from the University of California, Berkeley; and, M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from the University of Pennsylvania. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1966.\n\nShapiro held a postdoctoral fellowship from 1966 to 1968 at the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. He held a second post-doctoral fellowship at the Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory at the University of Rochester from 1968 to 1970. In 1970 he joined the physics faculty at California State University, Fullerton, and retired from the university in 2007. During his career he published 103 papers in refereed journals in such fields as experimental nuclear physics, experimental nuclear astrophysics, atmospheric physics, solid earth geophysics, computational condensed matter physics, and physics education. His most notable contributions were in the field of computational condensed matter physics where he used molecular dynamics techniques to explore the properties of ion and cluster collisions with solid and liquid targets. Shapiro together with T.A. Tombrello developed a model for calculating the core excitation of electrons to account for inelastic energy loss in sputtering events. The Shapiro-Tombrello model has been incorporated in the Kalypso molecular dynamics code\n\nShapiro also is known for the development together with Jonathan Melvin of the California Institute of Technology of one of the first \"smart\" remote sensing geophysical instruments. The Caltech Radon-Thoron Monitoring devices were remotely located throughout southern California. An on-board microprocessor controlled the operation of the device which periodically sampled water in deep wells for radon concentrations by measuring radioactive aerosols obtained by pumping air through the well water. Radon and environmental data obtained by the devices was periodically transmitted to a central computer at Caltech over telephone lines for analysis.\n\nShapiro was elected to fellowship in the American Physical Society, and upon retirement became a Senior Fellow of the American Physical Society\n\nIn addition, to his teaching and research activities Shapiro served as Chair of the physics department at Fullerton for a total of 10 years. He also served as a rotator in the Science and Engineering Education Directorate of the National Science Foundation. He also held visiting research appointments at the California Institute of Technology and at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nIn 1999 Shapiro began publishing an online journal of commentary on issues in K through 12 and higher education, The Irascible Professor, which includes articles by him and by guest commentators."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Mark H.

The concept of poetic tradition has been commonly used as a part of historical literary criticism, in which a poet or author is evaluated in the context of his historical period, his immediate literary influences or predecessors, and his literary contemporaries. T. S. Eliot claimed in \"Tradition and the Individual Talent\", published in 1919, that for a poet to fully come into his own, he must be aware of his predecessors, and view the work of his predecessors as living, not dead. The poetic tradition is a line of descent of poets who have achieved a sublime state and can surrender themselves to their work to create a poem that both builds on existing tradition and stands on its own.\n\nThe necessity of a poet to be aware of his place in relation to his poem and to his tradition, to surrender himself to his work and to the great masters preceding him, is revisited by Harold Bloom in his 1973 work, \"The Anxiety of Influence\". Bloom argued that each and every \u201cgreat poet\u201d must struggle with and overcome the anxiety of weakly imitating his predecessor poets. Bloom grounded his arguments on the work of Friedrich Nietzsche (notably \"Genealogy of Morals\") and Sigmund Freud, though he disagrees with the tendency of both authors to \u201cover-idealize the imagination.\u201d To Bloom, a poetic tradition is a tradition of creative misreading, with each upcoming poet clearing a space in the poetic tradition for himself or herself by alleging some inconsistency, or mistake, or insufficient progress on the part of his or her predecessor(s). He cites multiple examples in this work and in his other work on the same topic, \"A Map of Misreading\", published in 1975. One of these is the multiplicity of misreadings by poets and critics\u2014including T. S. Eliot, Northrop Frye, and Percy Shelley\u2014of Milton\u2019s epic poems, \"Paradise Lost\" and \"Paradise Regained\".\n\nPoetic tradition remains a problematic concept, subject to the same flaws as the poetic canon. One such flaw is the issue of marginalized groups, or subsets of the population, including female writers and writers of a non-Anglo-Saxon ethnicity or tradition. Virginia Woolf addressed the question of a woman\u2019s place in poetic tradition in \"A Room of One\u2019s Own\", asserting that, to produce artistic works, a woman (or indeed any poet) required personal space, financial support, and literary freedom. Woolf saw a place for women writers in the literary canon, but did not see a supporting system in place for women to use to get there. Notably, Bloom sees the development of a literary tradition as a primarily male-male struggle between father and son, referring several times to the myth of Oedipus. Literary tradition was also called into question for being almost exclusively Anglo-Saxon by Chinua Achebe, who criticized Joseph Conrad\u2019s canonical novella, \"Heart of Darkness\", for its racist images and attitudes in his 1975 essay, \u201cAn Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness.\u201d Achebe advocated a less subjective study of literary tradition through the accommodation of critical and creative works representing opposing viewpoints. The idea of a poetic tradition is an inherently problematic one, for while it is not so difficult to agree on who should be included in the line of poets that constitute a poetic canon, it is extremely difficult to divine what relation they bear to each other, and how to read their works."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Poetic tradition", "description": "A line of descent of poets who have achieved a sublime state and can surrender themselves to their work to create a poem that both builds on existing tradition and stands on its own", "types": ["Literary criticism", "Historical context", "Canon"]}, {"label": "Poetic canon", "description": "A body of works of significant literary merit, instrumental in shaping Western culture and modes of thought", "types": ["Literary criticism", "Western culture"]}, {"label": "Historical literary criticism", "description": "The evaluation of a poet or author in the context of his historical period, his immediate literary influences or predecessors, and his literary contemporaries", "types": ["Literary criticism", "Historical context"]}, {"label": "T.

The company had successes in the Schneider Trophy for seaplanes, with three wins in a row of 1927, 1929 and 1931.\n\nThe company was founded in 1913 as Pemberton-Billing Ltd on the River Itchen close to Woolston, Southampton, on ground previously purchased by Noel Pemberton Billing to construct motor launches. It produced a couple of prototypes using quadruplane designs to shoot down zeppelins, the Supermarine P.B.29 and the Supermarine Nighthawk. The aircraft were fitted with the recoilless Davis gun and the Nighthawk had a separate powerplant to power a searchlight.\nUpon election as an MP in 1916 Pemberton-Billing sold the company to his factory manager and longtime associate Hubert Scott-Paine who renamed the company Supermarine Aviation Works Ltd. The company became famous for its successes in the Schneider Trophy for seaplanes, especially the three wins in a row of 1927, 1929 and 1931.\n\nIn 1928 Vickers-Armstrongs took over Supermarine as Supermarine Aviation Works (Vickers) Ltd and in 1938 all Vickers-Armstrongs aviation interests were reorganised to become Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft) Ltd, although Supermarine continued to design, build and trade under its own name. The phrase Vickers Supermarine was applied to the aircraft. The first Supermarine landplane design to go into production was the famous and successful Spitfire. The earlier Hawker Hurricane and the Spitfire were the mainstay of RAF Fighter Command fighter aircraft which fought off the Luftwaffe bombing raids with fighter escorts during the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940. While the Hurricane was available in larger numbers and consequently played a larger role, the new Spitfire caught the popular imagination and became the aircraft associated with the battle. It went on to play a major part in the remainder of the war, in a number of variants and marks, and it was the only allied fighter aircraft to be in production through the entirety of the Second World War. Other planes from the period include the Seafire (a naval version of the Spitfire). Supermarine also developed the Spiteful and Seafang, the successors of the Spitfire and Seafire, respectively, and the Walrus flying boat. The Supermarine main works was heavily bombed in 1940. This curtailed work on their first heavy bomber design, the Supermarine B.12/36 which was replaced by the Short Stirling.\n\nAfter the end of the war, the Supermarine division built the Royal Navy's first jet fighter, the Attacker, developed from the final Spitfire type. It served front line squadrons aboard aircraft carriers and RNVR squadrons at shore bases. The Attacker was followed by the more advanced Swift which served in the fighter and photo-reconnaissance roles. The last of the Supermarine aircraft was the Scimitar. In the shakeup of British aircraft manufacturing, Vickers-Armstrongs (Aircraft) became a part of the British Aircraft Corporation and the individual manufacturing heritage names were lost."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Supermarine Aviation Works Ltd", "description": "A British aircraft manufacturer that produced the Spitfire fighter plane during World War II and a range of seaplanes and flying boats, and a series of jet-powered fighter aircraft after World War II.", "types": ["Company", "Aircraft Manufacturer"]}, {"label": "Spitfire", "description": "A British single-seat fighter aircraft used by the Royal Air Force during World War II.", "types": ["Aircraft", "Fighter Plane"]}, {"label": "Schneider Trophy", "description": "A seaplane racing competition that was held annually between 1913 and 1931.", "types": ["Competition", "Seaplane"]}, {"label": "Seaplane", "description": "An aircraft designed to take off and land on water.", "types": ["Aircraft", "Watercraft"]}, {"label": "Flying Boat", "description": "A fixed-winged seaplane with a hull that allows it to land on water.", "types": ["Aircraft", "Watercraft"]}, {"label": "Jet-powered fighter aircraft", "description": "A type of aircraft that uses jet propulsion to achieve faster speeds and higher altitudes than propeller-powered aircraft.", "types": ["Aircraft", "Fighter Plane", "Jet Engine"]}, {"label": "Schneider Trophy", "description": "A seaplane racing competition that was held annually between 1913 and 1931.", "types": ["Competition", "Seaplane"]}, {"label": "Noel Pemberton Billing", "description": "The founder of Pemberton-Billing Ltd, which later became Supermarine Aviation Works Ltd.", "types": ["Person", "Founder"]}, {"label": "Hubert Scott-Paine", "description": "The factory manager and longtime associate of Noel Pemberton Billing who bought the company and renamed it Supermarine Aviation Works Ltd.", "types": ["Person", "Manager"]}, {"label": "Vickers-Armstrongs", "description": "A British engineering conglomerate formed by the merger of Vickers Limited and Sir W G Armstrong Whitworth & Company in 1927.", "types": ["Company", "Engineering"]}, {"label": "Hawker Hurricane", "description": "A British single-seat fighter aircraft used by the Royal Air Force during World War II.", "types": ["Aircraft", "Fighter Plane"]}, {"label": "RAF Fighter Command", "description": "The organization responsible for the air defence of Great Britain during World War II.", "types": ["Organization", "Military"]}, {"label": "Luftwaffe", "description": "The German air force during World War II.", "types": ["Organization", "Military"]}, {"label": "Battle of Britain", "description": "A military campaign of the Second World War, in which the Royal Air Force defended the United Kingdom against large-scale attacks by Nazi Germany's air force, the Luftwaffe.", "types": ["Event", "Military Campaign"]}, {"label": "Seafire", "description": "A naval version of the Spitfire aircraft.", "types": ["Aircraft", "Fighter Plane", "Naval"]}, {"label": "Spiteful", "description": "A British fighter aircraft developed by Supermarine as a successor to the Spitfire.", "types": ["Aircraft", "Fighter Plane"]}, {"label": "Seafang", "description": "A British naval fighter aircraft developed by Supermarine as a successor to the Seafire.", "types": ["Aircraft", "Fighter Plane", "Naval"]}, {"label": "Walrus", "description": "A British single-engine amphibious biplane reconnaissance aircraft designed by R.

She spent a number of years working in the United States, on Broadway and in television, before returning to England.\n\nBorn in Middlesbrough, North Riding of Yorkshire, she often played motherly and/or comedic characters, mostly on television, including \"Cathy Come Home\" (1966) as a staff member at a homeless shelter, and \"My Son Reuben\" (1975), co-starring Bernard Spear, as a Jewish mother and her bachelor son who jointly run a dry-cleaning business. She also appeared in films including \"Blind Terror\" (1971), \"The Black Panther\" (1977) and \"Quincy's Quest\" (1979), and found film success in later years for her performances in \"An American Werewolf in London\" (1981) as the conflicted rural barmaid trying to warn off the two doomed American backpackers, in \"Nuns on the Run\" (1990) as a formidable nun, and in \"Reason for Living: The Jill Ireland Story\" (1991; an American television film), in which she played Dorothy Ireland, the real-life mother of cancer-stricken actress Jill Ireland (played by Jill Clayburgh). Kaye appeared in \"Bert Rigby, You're a Fool\" (1989) as Mrs. Pennington, and in \"Dragonworld\" (1994) as Mrs. Cosgrove.\n\nIn 1991, Lila played headmistress Mrs. Daphne Trout in series two and the first half of series three of the children's BBC TV Series Bodger and Badger.\n\nShe appeared as a nurse in a notable Royal Shakespeare Company production of John Vanbrugh's play, \"The Relapse\", at the Aldwych Theatre in London in 1967, alongside, among others, Donald Sinden, Patrick Stewart and Ben Kingsley. She debuted the role of Serafima Ilinitchna in Nikolai Erdman's \"The Suicide\" (1979). She was part of the cast of the Royal Shakespeare Company's epic stage production of \"Nicholas Nickleby\" on Broadway in 1981.\n\nKaye starred in the title role of the short-lived U.S. television series \"Mama Malone\" a year later. She made guest appearances on several U.S. television series, such as \"Murder, She Wrote\", \"Cheers\" and \"Dear John\" (reuniting her with \"An American Werewolf In London\" co-star Jenny Agutter). She resided in Florida before returning to Britain. Her last role was in the British television serial \"Julia Jekyll and Harriet Hyde\" in 1998, in which she appeared as \"Granny Jekyll\". After this role she announced her retirement."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Lila Kaye", "description": "English actress known for her motherly and comedic roles", "types": ["Actress",

independence in 1918. It was mandated by the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania in 1922. The census counted the total population of 2,028,971. It was the only census in interwar Lithuania. The next census was carried out in 1959 as part of the Soviet census. \n\nThe census results were organized into \"enumeration territories\" that followed county borders; of the 24 enumeration territories, four were cities that had been granted county rights (Kaunas, \u0160iauliai, Panev\u0117\u017eys, and Vilkmerg\u0117). Populations in the Vilnius Region, which had been incorporated into the Second Polish Republic, and the Klaip\u0117da Region, annexed by Lithuania in 1923, were not counted. The census cost 605,600 litas. Its 3,100 investigators consisted of civil servants and students enrolled in higher education. The data were transmitted to the Central Bureau of Statistics via telegraph and telephones. Results were published in statistical bulletins during 1924 and 1925, followed by a more public presentation in the Lithuanian and French languages in 1926.\n\nThe census found that 15.8% lived in towns with populations over 2,000 and about 75% of the population was employed in the agricultural sector. There were 27 cities, 241 towns, and 16,388 villages. 44.1% of the population was illiterate, including 32.6% of those over 10 years of age. A determination of ethnicity was made on the basis of language. The census found the population was 83.9% Lithuanian, 7.6% Jewish, 3.2% Polish, 2.5% Russian, 1.4% German, 0.4% Latvian, 0.2% Belarusian, and 0.8% others. The Polish Election Committee disputed the census' ethnic composition findings, stating that Poles comprised 10% of the population and Lithuanians 76.4%. The higher results were based on votes cast for Polish political candidates in the 1923 Lithuanian elections, which would put the Polish population at about 202,000 or between 9.5\u201310% of the population, interpreting election results in that manner, that everyone, voting for Polish candidate, must necessarily be Pole."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Lithuanian census of 1923",

The riding existed until 1972, when the name was changed to \"Renfrew North\u2014Nipissing East\".\n\nThe North Riding of Renfrew initially consisted of the Townships of Ross, Bromley, Westmeath, Stafford, Pembroke, Wilberforce, Alice, Petawawa, Buchanan, South Algona, North Algona, Fraser, McKay, Wylie, Rolph, Head, Maria, Clara, Haggerty, Sherwood, Burns, Richards, and any other surveyed Townships lying northwesterly of the said North Riding.\n\nIn 1892, \"North Renfrew\" was redefined to consist of the town of Pembroke, that part of the village of Eganville north of the River Bonnech\u00e8re, and the townships of Ross, Bromley, Westmeath, Stafford, Pembroke, Wilberforce, Alice, Petawawa, Buchanan, South Algona, North Algona, Fraser, McKay, Wylie and Rolph.\n\nIn 1903, it was redefined to consist of the townships of Algona North, Algona South, Alice, Bromley, Buchanan, Fraser, McKay, Pembroke, Petawawa, Rolph, Ross, Stafford, Westmeath, Wilberforce and Wylie, the town of Pembroke, the village of Cobden, and the part of the village of Eganville lying within the township of Wilberforce.\n\nIn 1924, \"Renfrew North\" was defined to consist of that part of the county of Renfrew lying north and east and including the townships of Ross, Bromley, Wilberforce, Algona (North and South), and Fraser, and including the part of the territorial district of Nipissing lying east of and including the townships of Cameron, Deacon, Anglin, Dickson, Preston, and Airy.\n\nIt was redefined several times following that, but generally included most of Renfrew County and the eastern part of Nipissing.\n\nThe electoral district was abolished in 1976 when it was redistributed between Nipissing, Parry Sound\u2014Muskoka and Renfrew\u2014Nipissing\u2014Pembroke ridings."},

Brooks was as much known for his swimming achievements as he was for disciplinary incidents. He often found himself in conflict with officialdom and threatened with sanctions. His international career ended when he was suspended for drinking 46 cans of beer on the return flight to Australia after the 1986 Commonwealth Games. In retirement, he became a news presenter and sports commentator, but was fired amid alcohol problems.\n\nBorn in England, Brooks emigrated to Australia as a toddler and started swimming lessons after nearly drowning in a childhood accident. After initially being known for his lack of technique, Brooks quickly rose through the youth ranks. Brooks made his debut at the Australian Championships in 1976, but it was not until 1979 that he medalled at national level and made his debut for Australia at a FINA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Natation) Swimming World Cup meet. In 1980, he gained prominence by breaking the Australian record in the 100\u00a0m freestyle and being invited to a national team camp. There he had his first clash with officialdom, walking out after accusing the officials of neglecting him. He then qualified for the Australian team for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, defying political pressure to boycott the Games in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Arriving in Moscow, Brooks' experience in the 100\u00a0m freestyle was an unpleasant one, suffering an asthma attack and missing the final. The peak of his swimming career came in the 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0m medley relay, when he caught and passed the Soviet Union's Sergey Kopliakov during the anchor leg to seal a narrow victory for Australia. This victory remains the only time that the United States did not win the event at Olympic level.\n\nFollowing the Olympics, Brooks was expelled from the Australian Institute of Sport by Don Talbot for disciplinary reasons. He accepted a swimming scholarship at the University of Arkansas, where he enjoyed the more liberal disciplinary standards. He returned to Australia for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane and again raised the ire of officials during a preparatory training camp. After lobbying for improved accommodation conditions, Brooks was involved in a physical altercation with the team manager. As a result, he was given a suspension that was to take effect after the Commonwealth Games. However, his teammates protested and threatened to walk out, resulting in the ban being rescinded. Despite the turbulent preparation, Brooks had a successful meet, winning the 100\u00a0m freestyle and anchoring the 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0m freestyle and medley relays to gold medals. Brooks competed at his second Olympics in Los Angeles in 1984 Games, where he won silver in the 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100\u00a0m freestyle relay and bronze for swimming the heats of the medley relay. Brooks' international career ended at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh with silver in the 100\u00a0m freestyle and gold in the freestyle relay. Brooks retired after being suspended for his drinking binge during the return trip. He later became a swimming commentator but was sacked in 1998 after a disciplinary incident."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Neil Brooks", "description": "Australian former sprint freestyle swimmer

multi-agency investigation of a drug trafficking organization in southern Arizona, between December 2012 and December 2013.\n\nAccording to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officials, the Phoenix-based Luiz Armando Cruz organization, which works for the Sinaloa Cartel of northern Mexico, is responsible for the smuggling of thousands of pounds of marijuana into Arizona and New Mexico and the smuggling of the proceeds back into Mexico, via the Agua Prieta corridor. The Cruz organization utilized both drivers in vehicles and backpackers to transport drug loads through remote desert areas near San Simon and Willcox, Arizona, and then to Tucson and Phoenix for further distribution.\n\nDEA Special Agent in Charge Doug Coleman: \"DEA and its partners are successfully striking back at drug traffickers who use the Arizona corridor to move their drugs into the United States and their illicit proceeds back to Mexico... This investigation identified a transportation cell that used human backpackers to smuggle thousands of pounds of marijuana across the Arizona/Mexico border. The message to these criminals should be clear\u2014use the cross border area at your own risk.\"\n\nOn the evening of December 13, 2013, police in Phoenix and Willcox conducted arrests and search warrants and raided stash houses believed to be used by the Cruz organization, arresting eleven individuals and seizing \"1,400 pounds of marijuana, seven rifles, two handguns, a shotgun, two homes, nine vehicles, an ATV quad and a bank account.\" Furthermore, since the beginning of the operation in December 2012, \"Kruz Control\" investigators seized $200,000, 27,000 pounds of marijuana, six vehicles and a King Quad ATV in other actions.\n\nThe following were arrested in police raids on December 13, 2013: Luis Armando Cruz, 39; Carlos Antonio Garcia, 31; Sergio Garcia-Morales, 32; Alma Dolores Escalante-Figueroa (wife of Cruz), 39; Felipe Escalante-Reyes, 22; Carime Itsel Reyes-Escalante, 19; Carlos Ramirez, 42; Sergio Robert Ramos-Moreno, 19; Trevon Xavier Marcus-Bondae, 18; Maxine Carter, 25; and Jeremiah Steven Woolsey, 24.\n\nThe following agencies participated in Operation Kruz Control: Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), U.S. Border Patrol and its Tactical Unit (BORTAC), the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, the U.S. Marshals Service, Graham County Attorney's Office, Coolidge Police Department, National Drug Intelligence Center Document and Media

He had contact with David Joris, probably before 1525, but his movement was not Anabaptist. In March 1525, Pruystinck visited Melanchthon and Luther in Wittenberg. In a letter he wrote immediately afterwards, Luther warned the Protestant community at Antwerp against him (and \"blustering and noisy spirits\" in general) by summarizing Pruystinck's doctrines as: every man possesses faith and the Holy Spirit, where the first is the desire to treat one's neighbor as oneself and the second is human reason and intelligence; all souls enjoy eternal life; only the flesh and not the spirit suffers hell; no sin has been committed when not acting on an evil thought and small children cannot sin. These doctrines have been compared to those of the much older Brethren of the Free Spirit and Beghards and the 15th-century Homines Intelligentiae of the Low Countries, and Pruystinck's movement was a form of Panentheism. The notion of radicalism was fueled by their rejection of religious marriage, lent, praying and other basic church regulations. \n\nCalled before the Inquisition of Antwerp in January 1526, Pruystinck and his followers recanted and were sentenced to public penance. They were let free on orders of Mary of Austria, Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands. Despite the recantation, his teaching spread through the Low Countries in the following years. In 1535 he met Christophe H\u00e9rault, a French Lutherian who had fled from Paris to Antwerp and who became a follower. While a pauper himself, his movement attracted many followers amongst merchants, rich citizens and even nobility. Pruystinck's teachings were written down, probably by Dominicus van Oucle, but this writing is lost. On July 14, 1544, H\u00e9rault and Pruystinck were arrested and tortured on accusation of interactions with David Joris and other Anabaptists. Many other Loists were captured, though quite a few managed to escape to England and Germany. In September and October of that year Dominicus van Oucle committed suicide in prison and H\u00e9rault and some other leaders were decapitated. Pruystinck himself was brought back to Antwerp, and after a sentencing on October 24, 1544, he was burned at the stake outside the city. It is unknown if he recanted before he died."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Eligius Pruystinck", "description": "Antwerp slater who became the leader of a radical Protestant faction named Loists",

Gemalto M2M's Cinterion products and services allow machines, equipment, vehicles and devices to communicate over cellular networks providing Edge-to-Enterprise (E2E) connectivity that enables the Internet of things (IoT). Unlike consumer-grade cellular technology, M2M technology is designed for longevity to withstand extreme conditions of temperature, moisture and vibration often encountered by enterprise and industrial wireless applications. Cinterion products and services are engineered to provide reliable communications for more than 10 years in the field.\n\nGemalto M2M's Cinterion products encompass a wide spectrum of M2M technologies across four categories including: \n* Wireless M2M modules \u2013 essentially a ruggedized radio chip that enables communication on both CDMA and GSM\u2013based cellular networks\n* Machine Identification Modules (short MIMs) \u2013 similar to a SIM card, MIMs securely identify machines, equipment and devices in the Internet Of Things as well as manage credentials, secure data and encrypt wireless transmissions\n* Subscription management services \u2013 technology that allows Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to remotely and securely provision service to specific devices and applications\n* The SensorLogic Application Enablement Platform (short AEP) \u2013 a secure, cloud-based application enablement platform that connects any M2M application to its backend server and integrates data and intelligence throughout an enterprise\n\nGemalto M2M's Cinterion portfolio of M2M products and services simplify development and integration of M2M solutions across all M2M vertical markets including: smart energy, automotive, mHealth, security, tracking and tracking, payment solutions, remote monitoring and control, industrial and building automation, mobile computing, routers and gateways. In addition to enabling cellular communications, Gemalto M2M offers a range of features, capabilities and technologies to strengthen M2M applications including embedded Java\u2122, GPS, Land Grid Array (LGA) surface mounting and SIM Access Profile. Cinterion products offer Full Type Approval (FTA) and local network operator certifications to ensure quick and easy integration with all global wireless networks. The company is an Associate Partner in the Intel Intelligent System Alliance (IISA) and the AT&T Mobile Broadband Accelerator Program (MBA)\n\nOriginated as the wireless module division of Siemens in 1995, Cinterion spun off in June 2008 led by Granville Baird, a venture capital company. In June 2010, Cinterion was acquired by Gemalto. Gemalto had 2012 annual revenues of \u20ac2.2 billion and more than 10,000 employees operating out of 83 offices and 13 Research & Development centers, located in 43 countries.

The Indians were coached by William T. Bull in his 1st year as head coach. The team compiled a record of 6\u20134 and outscored opponents 232 to 98.\n\nFrank Hudson was the quarterback. On the line were the brothers Bemus Pierce and Hawley Pierce. The two Pierce brothers, each weighing over 200 pounds, were both among the best players of their day. In 1906, \"The Washington Post\" declared them the greatest pair of linesman brothers in the history of the sport:\"But the greatest pair of brother linesmen were the Indians, Pierce. Bemus Pierce and Hawley Pierce were right guard and left tackle in the Carlisle line in the old days when the redskin booters of the prolate had everything in the country scared. Two hundred pounds apiece they weighed, and they won games for their team in 97. Tackle back and guard back for a solid half was the Indian play and it was 400 pounds of Pierce into the opponents' line pretty steady. Bemus was captain of the team and one of the best men on the kick-off football has seen. He could measure and place his kicks accurately and every red knew where the ball was going before it soared.\"\n\nHudson gained acclaim for drop-kicking field goals against two of the top teams in the country\u2014Yale and Penn. Hudson accounted for all of Carlisle's points in a 20-10 loss to Penn at Franklin Field in Philadelphia. \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"little Hudson showed his ability as a kicker by dropping the ball squarely between the posts.\" The game against Yale was played at the Polo Grounds in New York, and \"The New York Times\" described Hudson's field goal as follows:\"[S]teadying himself for an instant the ball was dropped and with a delicate touch from his foot was sent sailing straight as a die toward the Yale goal. The spectators held their breath and watched the ball as it sailed on just over the heads of the Yale players and finally dropped over the bar. Then they cheered and young Hudson was the hero of the day. The goal was one of the prettiest ever seen ...\"\n\nThe success of the Carlisle football team was a source of great pride for Native Americans. In 1897, the \"Indian Helper\" (the Carlisle school newspaper) described a celebration that greeted the football team on its return from a game played in New York City against Yale University:\"On Monday morning after breakfast, the football team, who returned the evening before from the Yale game which was played at New York last Saturday, was treated to a free ride across the parade, in the large four horse herdic, drawn by the entire battalion. Capt. Pierce, Frank Cayou, Frank Hudson, and Martin Wheelock occupied the small phaeton drawn by boys, and went in advance of the others. The band played lively marches, as handkerchiefs waved and mouths shouted. The demonstration was a great surprise to all making a unique scene for such an early morning hour. The school is proud of the record made for clean playing, and were gratified that the boys scored.\u201d"}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "1897 Carlisle Indians football team", "description": "The football team representing the Carlisle Indian Industrial School during the 1897 college football season", "types": ["Sports team", "Educational institution"]}, {"label": "William T.

"title": "Anne Rice", "text": "Anne Rice (born Howard Allen Frances O'Brien, October 4, 1941) is an American author of gothic fiction, Christian literature, and erotic literature.\nShe is best known for her series of novels \"The Vampire Chronicles\", which revolve around the central character Lestat. Books from \"The Vampire Chronicles\" were the subject of two film adaptations\u2014\"Interview with the Vampire\" (1994) and \"Queen of the Damned\" (2002).\n\nBorn in New Orleans, Rice spent much of her early life there before moving to Texas, and later to San Francisco. She was raised in an observant Catholic family, but became an agnostic as a young adult. She began her professional writing career with the publication of \"Interview with the Vampire\" in 1976, while living in California, and began writing sequels to the novel in the 1980s. In the mid-2000s, following a publicized return to Catholicism, Rice published the novels \"Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt\" and \"Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana\", fictionalized accounts of certain incidents in the life of Jesus. Several years later she distanced herself from organized Christianity, citing disagreement with the Church's stances on social issues but pledging that faith in God remained \"central to [her] life.\" However, she now considers herself a secular humanist.\n\nRice's books have sold nearly 100 million copies, placing her among the most popular authors in recent American history. While reaction to her early works was initially mixed, she became more popular with critics and readers in the 1980s. Her writing style and the literary content of her works have been analyzed by literary commentators. She was married to poet and painter Stan Rice for 41 years, from 1961 until his death from brain cancer in 2002 at age 60. She and Stan had two children, Michele, who died of leukemia at age five, and Christopher, who is also an author.\n\nIn addition to her vampire novels, Rice has authored books such as \"The Feast of All Saints\" (adapted for television in 2001) and \"Servant of the Bones\", which formed the basis of a 2011 comic book miniseries. Several books from \"The Vampire Chronicles\" have been adapted as comics and manga by various publishers. Rice has also authored erotic fiction under the pen names Anne Rampling and A.\u00a0N.\u00a0Roquelaure, including \"Exit to Eden\", which was later adapted into a 1994 film."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Anne Rice", "description": "American author of gothic fiction, Christian literature, and erotic literature", "types": ["Author", "Gothic fiction writer", "Christian literature writer", "Erotic literature writer"]}, {"label": "The Vampire Chronicles", "description": "Series of novels revolving around the central character Lestat", "types": ["Novel series", "Gothic fiction"]}, {"label": "Lestat", "description": "Central character in \"The Vampire Chronicles\"", "types": ["Fictional character", "Vampire"]}, {"label": "Interview with the Vampire", "description": "Novel published in 1976, first in \"The Vampire Chronicles\" series", "types": ["Novel", "Gothic fiction"]}, {"label": "Queen of the Damned", "description": "Third novel in \"The Vampire Chronicles\" series, adapted into a film in 2002", "types": ["Novel", "Gothic fiction", "Film adaptation"]}, {"label": "New Orleans", "description": "City in Louisiana, USA, where Anne Rice was born", "types": ["City", "Louisiana"]}, {"label": "Texas", "description": "State in the southern USA, where Anne Rice lived", "types": ["State", "USA"]}, {"label": "San Francisco", "description": "City in California, USA, where Anne Rice lived", "types": ["City", "California"]}, {"label": "Catholicism", "description": "Christian denomination in which Anne Rice was raised", "types": ["Religion", "Christianity", "Catholic"]}, {"label": "Agnostic", "description": "Religious belief of Anne Rice as a young adult", "types": ["Religion", "Agnosticism"]}, {"label": "Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt", "description": "Novel published in 2005, fictionalized account of certain incidents in the life of Jesus", "types": ["Novel", "Christian literature"]}, {"label": "Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana", "description": "Novel published in 2008, fictionalized account of certain incidents in the life of Jesus", "types": ["Novel", "Christian literature"]}, {"label": "Organized Christianity", "description": "Term used by Anne Rice to refer to the Church", "types": ["Religion", "Christianity", "Catholic"]}, {"label": "Secular humanist", "description": "Current religious belief of Anne Rice", "types": ["Religion", "Secular humanism"]}, {"label": "Stan Rice", "description": "Poet and painter, Anne Rice's husband for 41 years", "types": ["Poet", "Painter"]}, {"label": "Michele Rice", "description": "Anne Rice's daughter who died of leukemia at age five", "types": ["Individual", "Family member"]}, {"label": "Christopher Rice", "description": "Anne Rice's son, also an author", "types": ["Individual", "Family member", "Author"]}, {"label": "The Feast of All Saints", "description": "Novel by Anne Rice, adapted for television in 2001", "types": ["Novel", "Television adaptation"]}, {"label": "Servant of the Bones", "description": "Novel by Anne Rice, basis of a 2011 comic book miniseries", "types": ["Novel", "Comic book adaptation"]}, {"label": "Anne Rampling", "description": "Pen name used by Anne Rice for her erotic fiction", "types": ["Pen name", "Erotic literature writer"]}, {"label": "A.

Oyston took over the chairmanship at Blackpool from his mother, Vicki Oyston, in 1999. Mrs Oyston had taken over three years earlier when her husband Owen, Karl's father, was jailed for six years in 1996 for rape and indecent assault. The \"Sunday Times\" Rich List listed the Oystons' wealth at \u00a3100 million.\n\nAt the time of Oyston's appointment, Blackpool were in the third tier of the Football League. At the end of the following 1999\u20132000 campaign, they were relegated to the bottom tier. At the first time of asking, they returned to the Second Division, where they remained for the next six seasons. In 2007 they were promoted to the second tier. Three years later, after financial backing from new club president Val\u0113rijs Beloko\u0146s, Blackpool were, for the first time, promoted to the Premier League. After this promotion, Beloko\u0146s was frozen out of day-to-day involvement, he claims because the Oystons no longer needed his financial backing. \n\nBlackpool remained in the top tier for one campaign, and after failing to return from the Championship at the first attempt, they have finished no higher than 15th, with Oyston employing four different managers since 2013. In 2015, Blackpool were relegated to the third tier for the first time since 2007. The following season saw a second-successive relegation, to the bottom tier of English professional football for the first time in fifteen years.\n\nOyston had a poor relationship with Blackpool's fans, mostly after the club's relegation from the Premier League, due to a perceived lack of funding. The relationship was described as being \"at breaking point\" by Tim Fielding, the chair of the Blackpool Supporters Trust, in December 2014.\n\nFielding resigned from his position the following month after the Oystons began legal action against him for comments he made on the internet, even though it was revealed that Karl Oyston had labelled Blackpool fan Stephen Smith a \"massive retard\" and an \"intellectual cripple\" in a text-message exchange two months earlier. The local newspaper, the \"Blackpool Gazette\", subsequently decided to scrap Oyston's weekly column \"given such disgusting and offensive comments\". He was later charged with misconduct by the Football Association, a charge he appealed. The appeal was rejected by a tribunal, and he was given a ban from all footballing activities for six weeks and fined \u00a340,000.\n\nOn 6 November 2017, the Oystons were found in a High Court judgement to have operated an \"illegitimate stripping\" of Blackpool F.C., paying \u00a326.77 million out of the club to companies they owned. The Oystons decided to put the club up for sale following the judgement.\n\nOn 2 February 2018, Oyston rescinded his role as chairman of the football club."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Karl

Crompton", "text": "Louis Crompton (born April 5, 1925, Port Colborne, Ontario; died July 11, 2009, El Cerrito, California), son of Master Mariner Clarence and Mabel Crompton, was a Canadian-born scholar, professor, author, and pioneer in the instruction of queer studies.\n\nCrompton received an M.A. in mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1948 and a Ph.D. in English from the University of Chicago in 1954. After teaching mathematics at the University of British Columbia and the University of Toronto, he joined the English department at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1955, retiring in 1989. During his career, he gained an international reputation as a scholar of the works of George Bernard Shaw.\n\nIn 1970, Crompton taught a gay studies class at UNL, the second such course offered in the United States, an action that raised LGBT awareness in academia, Nebraska, and the nation. The course provoked one Nebraska state legislator into introducing a bill that would ban any teaching on homosexuality in any Nebraska public college; the bill was not passed into law. However, Crompton decided not to offer the course again, but continued to pursue the subject through research and publication.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Crompton became the faculty advisor for the Gay Action Group, forerunner of today's UNL Queer Ally Coalition, and also helped found the UNL Homophobia Awareness Committee, which became the Committee on Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Concerns. In 1974, Crompton co-founded the Gay and Lesbian Caucus of the Modern Language Association.\n\nIn 1978, Crompton scored a literary coup by editing and publishing in the \"Journal of Homosexuality\" the full text of \"Offences Against One's Self: Paederasty,\" a never-before published 1785 essay by utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham. Bentham had suppressed the essay during his lifetime, for fear of public outrage at his views on liberalizing the laws concerning homosexual activity.\n\nCrompton received many awards and honors during his career, including the Bonnie Zimmerman and Vern L. Bullough Prize of the Foundation for the Scientific Study of Sexuality award for 2003 for his book \"Homosexuality and Civilization\", which covers 2500 years of world history.\n\nIn 2009, a scholarship was established at UNL in Crompton's name for students working toward \"a more just, inclusive society for the LGBTQ community\"; the first award to a student was made in 2013. At the time of his death, Crompton, who had retired to California, was Professor Emeritus of English at UNL. He was survived by his partner of forty years, Luis Diaz-Perdomo, also a former UNL faculty member who served many years with Counseling and Psychological Services at UNL and facilitated the Gay Men\u2019s Discussion Group."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Louis Crompton", "description": "Canadian-born scholar, professor, author, and pioneer in the instruction of queer studies", "types": ["Academic", "Author", "Scholar", "Professor", "LGBTQ Activist"]}, {"label": "University of Toronto", "description": "University where Crompton received his M.A. in mathematics", "types": ["University", "Mathematics"]}, {"label": "University of Chicago", "description": "University where Crompton received his Ph.D. in English", "types": ["University", "English"]}, {"label": "University of British Columbia", "description": "University where Crompton taught mathematics", "types": ["University", "Mathematics"]}, {"label": "University of Nebraska-Lincoln", "description": "University where Crompton joined the English department and taught for many years", "types": ["University", "English", "LGBTQ Activist"]}, {"label": "George Bernard Shaw", "description": "Author whose works Crompton was a scholar of", "types": ["Author", "Scholar"]}, {"label": "LGBT", "description": "Acronym for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community", "types": ["Community", "LGBTQ Activist"]}, {"label": "Nebraska state legislator", "description": "Individual who introduced a bill to ban teaching on homosexuality in any Nebraska public college", "types": ["Politician"]}, {"label": "Gay Action Group", "description": "Group for LGBTQ activism at UNL", "types": ["LGBTQ Activist"]}, {"label": "UNL Queer Ally Coalition", "description": "Group for LGBTQ activism at UNL", "types": ["LGBTQ Activist"]}, {"label": "UNL Homophobia Awareness Committee", "description": "Committee for LGBTQ activism at UNL", "types": ["LGBTQ Activist"]}, {"label": "Committee on Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Concerns", "description": "Committee for LGBTQ activism at UNL", "types": ["LGBTQ Activist"]}, {"label": "Modern Language Association", "description": "Association where Crompton co-founded the Gay and Lesbian Caucus", "types": ["Association", "LGBTQ Activist"]}, {"label": "Jeremy Bentham", "description": "Utilitarian philosopher who wrote an essay on paederasty, published by Crompton", "types": ["Philosopher", "Author"]}, {"label": "\"Offences Against One's Self: Paederasty\"", "description": "Essay written by Bentham and published by Crompton", "types": ["Essay", "LGBTQ Activist"]}, {"label": "Journal of Homosexuality", "description": "Journal where Crompton published Bentham's essay", "types": ["Journal", "LGBTQ Activist"]}, {"label": "Bonnie Zimmerman and Vern L.

Miller and Pyle had been working together in National Health and had been in Hatfield and the North with Sinclair before that, while Pyle and Dean were longstanding collaborators too, recently having worked together in the Weightwatchers (with pianist Keith Tippett) and Soft Heap. Early in 1985, Hugh Hopper replaced Sinclair. The band appeared on Miller's first solo album, \"Cutting Both Ways\" (released 1987).\n\nIn 1987, Steve Franklin replaced Lemer, and in 1988 Fred Baker replaced Hopper. This line-up appeared on Miller's solo album \"Split Seconds\", while \"In Cahoots Live 86-89\" was released in 1989 (released under the name Phil Miller/In Cahoots like all their albums). In 1990, Franklin left and the band was joined by Jim Dvorak on trumpet. Baker and Lemer appeared on Miller's \"Digging In\" (1991), which also had programmed drums by Pip Pyle.\n\nIn 1991, Miller and Pyle were reunited with Hopper in Short Wave. In Cahoots continued with a Japanese tour, including Lemer, documented on \"Live in Japan\" (1993). The next studio effort, \"Recent Discoveries\", was recorded in 1993. Lemer rejoined the band in 1995 and they recorded \"Parallel\" (1996) and \"Out of the Blue\" (2001), which saw Caravan guitarist Doug Boyle sitting in on two tracks (he also took part in a brief European tour that year).\n\nIn 2002, Mark Fletcher replaced Pyle and the line-up of Miller, Fletcher, Dean, Dvorak, Baker and Lemer released \"All That\" in 2003. In 2004, Dean and Dvorak left and, since then, the brass section consists of Simon Picard on tenor sax, Simon Finch on trumpet, and occasionally Gail Brand on trombone. Former Short Wave collaborator Didier Malherbe, however, was the featured saxophonist on Miller's latest effort, 2006's \"Conspiracy Theories\", which also included guest spots by Richard Sinclair, Dave Stewart and Doug Boyle."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Cahoots", "description": "A Canterbury scene band led by guitarist Phil Miller.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "Phil Miller",

This musical project is unique in Chile, and its hybrid sound has been called \"klezmer a la chilena\" by press.\n\nIts first references were Jazz manouche, Klezmer, Balkan and Gypsy music, rhythms to which later they would incorporate Latin influences like Cumbia, Mambo, Cha-cha-cha, Tango and Rumba; creating a cosmopolitan sonority. \nFrom its beginning, the band was a precursor in spreading the Gypsy, Balkan and Klezmer rhythms in Chilean stages; and today, after almost a decade, they are one of the most important and celebrated bands from the so called \u201cnew culture of musical carnival\u201d that has taken place in Chile in the last years.\n\nLa Mano Ajena has played in many stages abroad and inside of Chile, in countries as Denmark, Spain, Serbia and Argentina. In Santiago, they have shared stage with bands as Gogol Bordello and Emir Kusturica & The No Smoking Orchestra.\nIn January, 2009, they became the first and only Latin American band to participate in the K\u00fcstendorf Film and Music Festival in Serbia, created by the twice Palm d\u2019Or winner in Cannes and world famous filmmaker Emir Kusturica, whose band The No Smoking Orchestra is the main and most important reference concerning Balkan and Gypsy music in the world.\n\nLa Mano Ajena incorporates in its work a traditional repertoire sung in diverse languages: Gypsy language, Yiddish, Hebrew, French, English and Spanish. Its members are 8 multi-instrumentalists: Rodrigo Latorre, soprano saxophone, alto saxophone, baritone saxophone, guitar, piccolo flute, keyboard and theremin; Mar\u00eda Fernanda Carrasco, vocals, keyboard, melodica and minor percussion; Danka Villanueva, violin and marimba; Gabriel Moyla, accordion, alto saxophone and baritone saxophone; Jair Moreno, clarinet; \u00c1lvaro S\u00e1ez, drums, darbuka and djembe; and Cristian Aqueveque, electric bass and double bass.

Each year, during the month of August it presents two to three operas as well as performances from visiting ballet and theatre companies, solo recitals, and choral, symphonic, and chamber music concerts. Its largest and main performing space is the Palacio de Festivales on the Calle Gamazo in Santander. However, performances are also held in fifty churches, cloisters, and parks both in Santander and in smaller towns in the Cantabria region.\n\nFrom 1952 to 1990 the festival's main performance space was a gigantic tent in Santander's Plaza Porticada. The final performance there was a concert by the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra and Mstislav Rostropovich on August 30, 1990. Upon its completion in 1991, the Palacio de Festivales, became the festival's new home. It was inaugurated with a performance by the King's Consort of Handel's oratorio, \"Joshua\". The building was designed by Francisco Javier S\u00e1enz de Oiza. Its main auditorium, the Sala Argenta, is noted for its transparent and natural-sounding acoustics and has a seating capacity of 1670. Unusually, the backdrop of its stage is a large window looking out onto the Bay of Santander. The auditorium is named in honour of the Spanish conductor Ata\u00falfo Argenta, who played a major role in the establishment of the festival.\n\nThe festival had its beginnings in 1948 as a programme providing cultural entertainment to the foreign students at the Universidad Internacional Men\u00e9ndez Pelayo. By 1952 it had become a fully fledged international music festival with Jos\u00e9 Manuel Riancho as its first Director. Jos\u00e9 Luis Ocejo, a noted conductor and founder of the Coral Salv\u00e9 de Laredo, has been its Director since 1979. Many of the festival's performances are broadcast live on Spanish National Radio (RTVE). The RTVE-M\u00fasica label has issued eight of these performances on CD, including the 2003 production of \"Simon Boccanegra\" and the Berlin Philharmonic's 2004 concert of works by Mahler, Bruckner and Beethoven.\n\nAmongst the many distinguished conductors, musicians and singers who have appeared at the Festival Internacional de Santander over the years are: Zubin Mehta, Sir Georg Solti, Riccardo Muti, Arthur Rubinstein, Alicia de Larrocha, Daniel Barenboim, Diletta Rizzo Marin, Montserrat Caball\u00e9, Teresa Berganza, Samuel Ramey, Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez, Mirella Freni, Jos\u00e9

South Yorkshire, England. On Saturday, 4 April 2009, an 11-year-old boy was found with critical head injuries at a ravine in a rural area of Edlington, while his nine-year-old nephew was found wandering nearby covered in blood.\n\nOn Tuesday, 7 April, two brothers, aged 10 and 11, who had been arrested on Sunday, 5 April, were each initially charged with the attempted murder and robbery of both of the injured boys. They appeared at Sheffield Crown Court, where a hearing revealed the extent of their actions. They had led the two boys to an isolated wasteland where one was forced to strip naked and perform a sex act. A metal ring was used to strangle the other. The brothers collected stones and bricks which were thrown at the boys' heads. When alerted by the sound of passers-by, the suspects covered the two boys with a sheet, which they then set afire, inflicting burns on the victims. One brother had filmed part of the attack on his mobile phone, which was used as evidence in court.\n\nThe two suspects pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, to robbing one of the boys of a mobile phone and the other of cash, to two counts of intentionally causing a child to engage in sexual activity, and to one additional charge of actual bodily harm relating to a previous incident involving another 11-year-old boy. A child protection expert, Eileen Vizard, who had been involved in the James Bulger case, told the sentencing judge that the younger brother was a \"very high risk\" to the community and was at risk of becoming \"a seriously disturbed psychopathic offender\" unless he was properly treated.\n\nThe brothers were given indeterminate sentences on 23 January 2010. The judge in the case, Mr Justice Keith, ordered that under Section 39 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 their identities should not be disclosed. A request to appeal against the sentence was refused by the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal on 5 May 2010.\n\nIn December 2016, the perpetrators were granted legal lifelong anonymity on the grounds that they would be \"at serious risk of attack\" if their identities became known.\n\nIn August 2017, shortly after release, the younger of the brothers was returned to prison indefinitely after breaching the terms of his parole; he was found in possession of a machete."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "The Edlington attacks", "description": "A case of abduction and torture of two

Since renovations and the opening of the Hudson River Park's new Greenwich Village segment in 2003, it has retained its role as a gathering place for gay youth from New York City and New Jersey who have been congregating at the pier since the 1970s.\n\nHowever, residents of Christopher Street have complained about noisy teenagers leaving the park after its 1 a.m. curfew. Neighborhood leaders and speculators in the area's townhouse market make frequent use of the term \"unruly\" to describe the pier's users, many of whom are African American or Latino gay youth. Opponents of plans to displace the pier's users have sometimes accused neighborhood leaders and speculators of employing racist code to solicit support for their planned changes. Community residents created a new plan in 2005 to have the Park Enforcement Patrol escort the teens to the 14th and Hudson Street exits. According to an article in \"AM New York Metro\", \"A proposal by Connie Fishman ... to barricade the park\u2019s Christopher St. exit at 1 a.m., when the Hudson River Park closes ... and thus reduce late-night noise and crowding on Christopher St.\" The teenage users of the park responded angrily to the proposed restrictions on the Christopher Street exit and asked instead for the curfew to be moved to 4 a.m., arguing that there will be less of a crowd leaving the park at that time. A group called FIERCE (Fabulous Independent Educated Radicals for Community Empowerment) has been helping LGBT youth fight for later curfews at Christopher Street Pier; a 2001 film showcased the group's campaign to save the pier.\n\nThe state's first memorial to the LGBT community was dedicated in June 2018, at the Hudson River Park near the Christopher Street Pier. The memorial, an abstract work by Anthony Goicolea, consists of nine boulders arranged in a circle. The memorial honors the victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, most of whom were gay."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Christopher Street Pier", "description": "A group of piers in Hudson

rate of extraction of petroleum is reached, after which it is expected to enter terminal decline. , peak oil forecasts range from 2019 to the 2040s, depending on economics and how governments respond to global warming. It is often confused with oil depletion; however, whereas \"depletion\" refers to a period of falling reserves and supply, \"peak oil\" refers to the point of maximum production. The concept of peak oil is often credited to geologist M. King Hubbert whose 1956 paper first presented a formal theory. Peak coal was in 2013 and peak oil is forecast to occur before peak gas.\n\nMost early analyses concentrated on increasing costs of extraction and assumed that demand would drive costs higher. More recent analyses concentrate on drop in demand as alternatives to oil become more attractive.\n\nSome observers, such as petroleum industry experts Kenneth S. Deffeyes and Matthew Simmons, predicted there would be negative global economy effects after a post-peak production decline and subsequent oil price increase because of the continued dependence of most modern industrial transport, agricultural, and industrial systems on the low cost and high availability of oil.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, conventional crude oil production peaked in 2006. A 2013 study concluded that peak oil \"appears probable before 2030\", and that there was a \"significant risk\" that it would occur before 2020, and assumed that major investments in alternatives will occur before a crisis, without requiring major changes in the lifestyle of heavily oil-consuming nations. Predictions of future oil production made in 2007 and 2009 stated either that the peak had already occurred, that oil production was on the cusp of the peak, or that it would occur soon. These predictions proved false as world oil production rose and hit a new high in 2018, although most of this increase in supply in the United States comes from deposits of tight oil, which is costlier to extract than conventional oil and requires substantial capital for investment.\n\nHubbert's original prediction that US peak oil would occur in about 1970 appeared accurate for a time, as US average annual production peaked in 1970 at 9.6\u00a0million barrels per day and mostly declined for more than three decades after. However, the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling caused US production to rebound starting around 2005. In addition, Hubbert's original predictions for world peak oil production proved premature. The rate of discovery of new petroleum deposits peaked worldwide during the 1960s and has not approached these levels since."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Peak oil", "description": "The year when the maximum rate of extraction of petroleum is reached, after which it is expected to enter terminal decline", "types": ["Energy", "Fossil fuel"]}, {"label": "Peak coal", "description": "The year when the maximum rate of extraction of coal is reached, after which it is expected to enter terminal decline", "types": ["Energy", "Fossil fuel"]}, {"label": "Peak gas", "description": "The year when the maximum rate of extraction of natural gas is reached, after which it is expected to enter terminal decline", "types": ["Energy", "Fossil fuel"]}, {"label": "Petroleum", "description": "A liquid mixture of hydrocarbons that is present in certain rock strata and can be extracted and refined to produce fuels including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel", "types": ["Energy", "Fossil fuel"]}, {"label": "M.

Wisconsin, and the seat of local government for 70 years. In 1997 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its intact Late Victorian architecture and its role in the community.\n\nThe first permanent settler at what would become Omro was Edward West, in 1845. By 1848 he had been joined by dozens of other settlers - mostly farmers. Sawmills on the river followed shortly, and in 1849 the village of Omro was platted. In 1857 the village was chartered. More businesses started, and even more after the railroad arrived in 1861. By 1891, Omro's population was 1600.\n\nIn that year the village trustees created a fire department, buying a horse-drawn fire engine and two hand-pulled hose carts. This expensive equipment needed protection, so the trustees bought a small frame building to serve as Omro's first fire engine house. At that early date, all the village offices were scattered around town.\n\nA few years later, in 1895, the village board decided to construct a better building \"for the use of the fire department, etc.\" Local builder and architect Fred Root proposed a design in February, 1896. Bids were taken, and by July the building was usable. Thomas Thompson was the masonry contractor and Stanton, Lillicrap and Root were carpentry contractors. The hall was built for $5000.\n\nThe building sits on a cut stone foundation, with walls of pink brick rising two stories to a hip roof, which is covered in the original standing seam metal. Above the main block a large square tower rises another two stories, incorporating a four-faced Seth Thomas clock and an open belfry. The belfry holds the original 900-pound bronze fire bell. The vertical emphasis, the asymmetrical massing, and the variety of surface textures are typical elements of Queen Anne architectural style.\n\nInside, the garage doors led to an engine room on the first floor, where the fire department stored its equipment. To the west, the front room originally housed the village jail, but later the public library. A straight stairway leads to the second floor, which is divided into three rooms. One was the office of the village clerk, containing a walk-in vault which protected the clerk's papers. \n\nThe 1896 village hall and engine house was used until 1966, when most of its functions moved to the Omro Theatre building. After that, some wanted to demolish the building to create parking spaces, but that was rejected in a referendum. Instead the building housed some civic organizations until 1981. Since then it has been leased to the Omro Area Historical Society and serves as a museum."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Omro Village Hall and Engine House", "description": "A historic building

Me", "text": "A Special Part of Me is an album by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was released on January 22, 1984, by Columbia Records and reunited him with his \"Too Much, Too Little, Too Late\" partner Deniece Williams on one of the LP's two duets, \"Love Won't Let Me Wait\", which is also the only song on the album that was previously recorded and released by another artist. This continuing trend away from the cover album genre would reach its limit with his next studio release, \"Right from the Heart\", which only had original material.\n\n\"A Special Part of Me\" made its first appearance on \"Billboard\" magazine's Top LPs & Tapes chart in the issue dated March 10, 1984, and remained there for 19 weeks, peaking at number 157. It also made it to number 45 during a three-week run on the UK album chart that began on September 15 of that year.\n\n\"Love Won't Let Me Wait\" had its chart debut on \"Billboard\" magazine's list of the 100 most popular R&B singles in the US in the issue dated February 25, 1984, where it peaked at number 32 over the course of 12 weeks. The March 24 issue marked its first appearance on the magazine's list of the 50 most popular Adult Contemporary records in the US, where it spent 13 weeks and reached number 14. The next issue, dated March 31, saw its debut on the \"Bubbling Under the Hot 100\" chart, where it got as high as number 106.\n\nAnother song from the album, \"Simple\", began a 12-week run on the R&B chart two months later, in the May 19 issue, that took the song to number 43. The Adult Contemporary chart in the following issue, dated May 26, was its next debut and the beginning of a 16-week stay, during which time it made it to number six. It also enjoyed eight weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 that began the following month, in the issue dated June 23, giving Mathis a number 81 hit, and reached number eight on the Canadian AC chart.\n\nThe fact that the front cover photograph was taken at the Carlyle Hotel in Miami, Florida, and the choice of pastels for both the album design and the clothing Mathis wears in the photo might suggest that the look was inspired by the influential hit show \"Miami Vice\", but the television series debuted on September 16, 1984\u2014eight months after this album was released.\n\nOn January 15, 2013, Funkytowngrooves released an expanded edition of the album on compact disc that included two additional versions of \"Simple\" that came out in 1984 on a separate 12-inch single."},

"1990\u201391 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team", "text": "The 1990\u201391 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team represented Princeton University in intercollegiate college basketball during the 1990\u201391 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The head coach was Pete Carril and the team captain was Kit Mueller. The team played its home games in the Jadwin Gymnasium on the University campus in Princeton, New Jersey. The team was the undefeated champion of the Ivy League, which earned them an invitation to the 64-team 1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament where they were seeded eighth in the East Region.\n\nThe team posted a 24\u20133 overall record and a 14\u20130 conference record using the Princeton offense. When the team beat 55\u201327 on January 11, 1991, it established a new National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I record for fewest points allowed (since 1986), breaking its own record set the prior year. The record would last until March 2, 1992. On February 8, 1991, against , Sean Jackson made all five of his three-point field goal attempts, which tied the Ivy League single-game record for most made without a miss set three years earlier by Princeton Tigers Dave Orlandini and Bob Scrabis. These stood as unsurpassed as the Ivy League record until future Princeton Tigers head coach Sydney Johnson made all six for Princeton on February 28, 1997. In a March 15, 1991 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament East Regional first round game at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York, against the Villanova Wildcats, they lost by a 50\u201348 margin. The Tigers led 30\u201325 at halftime, but lost on a shot in the final second of regulation play. Princeton's number eight seed was a record for the highest seed by an Ivy League school at the time.\n\nDuring the season, the team spent six weeks (one week in mid December and the final five weeks of the season) of the seventeen-week season ranked in the Associated Press Top Twenty-five Poll, peaking at number eighteen where it ended the season. The team finished the season ranked twentieth in the final UPI Coaches' Poll.\n\nThe team was led by first team All-Ivy League selections Jackson and Mueller, who repeated as the Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Year while earning first team Academic All-America recognition from College Sports Information Directors of America. Mueller shot 62.5% on his field goals to earn the third of three Ivy League statistical championships for field goal percentage. Jackson led the Ivy League in three point shooting percentage in conference games with a 55.4% average and established the Ivy League single-season record for conference games with 56 made. The team won the third of twelve consecutive national statistical championships in scoring defense with a 48.9 points allowed average."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "1990-91 Princeton Tigers men's

This area may have been the art collection (\"museion\") of the Attalid kings. When the statue was found, there were still traces of paint on it: the aegis had parts in light and dark blue, the snakes were red, and there were other bits of colour on the hem. These traces of colour can no longer be perceived, except for a painted band on the soles of her shoes. The statue is largely intact, except for the right arm and one fold of her drapery. The left arm has been reconstructed from a number of fragments. The head was only found several months after the body and was more heavily corroded than the rest of the statue. It was made separately and inserted into the main statue. The head was looted by the Russians and is now lost; a plaster cast sits in its place.\n\nAthena wears a girdled Doric peplos, which leaves her arms free and falls to her hips. Especially on the right hand side, it is characterised by elegant flowing folds. The unusual, cross-strapped form of the aegis is the source of the statue's common name. It is formed of two separate strips which run under the arms and cross in front of the bosom and in the same space at the back. These strips are probably meant to imitate the design of furs. On the lower edge of the strips of the aegis there are small curves, from which small serpents emerge. These are partially carved in free relief, and are shown winding around themselves, tying themselves into knots, and striking out. Where the aegis crosses, there is a Gorgoneion, which turns away evil, depicted as a brooch. Her hair falls in gentle locks. It is tied back from the face and held in a bun at the back of the head. From the surviving top portion of the missing right arm, it is clear that it must have been bent. Since the head is also turned slightly to the right and downwards, it has been suggested that the goddess held a small Nike or a lance in her hand. Her left hand might have held a lance or perhaps a helmet (vehemently denied by many archaeologists).\n\nThe statue follows classical models of around 430/20 BC, but it was actually made in the Hellenistic period, around 150 BC, and lacks the self-centred harmony and calm of its models. The posture of the head and right arm in connection with the placement of the weight-bearing right leg further to the rear suggest a jerky movement. The left leg is bent, with the knee extending further forward. The way her clothing sits also suggests a tense restlessness. In composition and execution, the statue blends the classical model with the new ideas of the Hellenistic age. Aspects of her clothing seem to derive from the Great frieze of the Pergamon altar. There is also a connection to the Statue of Athena, which Myron made on Samos and which many archaeologists have wished to see this as a copy of."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Athena with

The car is an aerodynamic improvement on its predecessor, the TS030 Hybrid, and its design allowed four-wheel drive. It has two kinetic energy recovery system (KERS) regenerative-braking devices at the front and rear axles to charge a supercapacitor and, in accordance with the 2014 regulations, was placed in the class.

Toyota supplied two cars, driven by six drivers, for the season. Nicolas Lapierre, Anthony Davidson and S\u00e9bastien Buemi won the season's opening two races in the No. 8 car; Lapierre aquaplaned, crashing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans before recovering to finish third. After the crash, Lapierre was dropped and Buemi and Nakajima won two more races and had another podium finish to win the 2014 World Endurance Drivers' Championship. Consistent performances from Alexander Wurz, St\u00e9phane Sarrazin, Kazuki Nakajima and reserve driver Mike Conway won Toyota the World Endurance Manufacturers' Championship at the season-ending 6 Hours of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nThe car was further developed after the 2014 24 Hours of Le Mans in accordance with the 2015 regulations. The front of the TS040 changed, a new suspension preserved tyre life, its supercapacitor was altered for better performance, and two body kits were created to match the car to a track. Although the season began with a third-place finish for the No. 1 car (driven by Buemi, Nakajima and Davidson) at the 6 Hours of Silverstone, the TS040 struggled against rivals Audi and Porsche in the seven remaining rounds before Wurz, Sarrazin and Conway's No. 2 entry finished second at the season-ending 6 Hours of Bahrain; Toyota placed third in the World Endurance Manufacturers' Championship.

century BC) was a Gaul of the \"civitas\" of the Aedui. He was the first high priest (\"sacerdos\") of the Altar of the Deified Caesar at Lugdunum (modern Lyon, France), which was inaugurated August 1 in either 12 or 10 BC at the confluence of the Sa\u00f4ne and Rhone rivers. The dating of the inauguration to 12 would connect it to the year in which Augustus assumed the office of pontifex maximus.\n\nThe Imperial cult at Lugdunum was the first and most important in the Western empire. It was established by Drusus, the stepson of Augustus, in the wake of a Gallic rebellion. Representatives from more than 60 Gallic nations attended. The date of August 1 seems to have been chosen to honor Augustus, being the Kalends of the month newly renamed after him, and in the Celtic calendar also a significant date, later celebrated as Lughnasadh. \n\nIn addition to his priesthood of the Imperial cult for the Three Gauls (\"Tres Galliae\"), Vercondaridubnus held Roman citizenship. He also had a role in his provincial deliberative body (\"concilium\"), which had legal power to negotiate with the Roman administration. Although the priesthood was an annual office, its holders would have held great influence thereafter. As the most notable men of the Three Gauls were invited to the inaugural ceremony, Vercondaridubnus would have been someone of great consequence to both Romans and Gauls in his province. The Aedui had been allies of Rome since the 120s BC, with the relationship expressed formally as that of \u201cbrothers\u201d (\"fratres\"), and in the 1st century AD produced the first Roman senators from Gallia Comata.\n\nThe name Gaius Julius Vercondaridubnus is a hybrid of Latin and Celtic nomenclature. His Latin praenomen and nomen are markers of his citizenship; he may have assumed the name Gaius Julius in honour of Gaius Julius Caesar (as the \"divus Julius\" of Imperial cult). His father, like other Gaii Julii of the Aedui, may even have been granted Roman citizenship directly by Caesar in the aftermath of the Gallic Wars, since it was customary for naturalized citizens to take the gentilic name of their patron. The Celtic personal name Vercondaridubnus has been interpreted as meaning \u201cThe Dark One of Great Wrath.\u201d The prefix \"ver-\" is hierarchical (\u201cabove, highest, supreme\u201d); \"con-\" (\"com\"-) is combinative (\u201cwith\u201d) or intensive. The element \"dari-\" refers to a violent emotion such as rage. \"Dubn-\" is a relatively common Celtic element meaning \u201cdark, shadowy,\u201d perhaps \u201chidden, secret\u201d and hence \u201cdeep, profound\u201d; as a noun, \"dubnos\" can mean \u201cthe Deep World,\u201d i.e., the underworld. Since Vercondaridubnus was a priest, this meaning of \"dubnos\" may apply.\n\nIn the 1st century AD, the successors of Vercondaridubnus included Marcus Lucterius Sencianus of the Cadurces and Gaius

on the northern side of Rougemont Castle. They are the oldest public open space in England, being originally laid out in 1612 as a pleasure walk for Exeter residents. The gardens are Grade II listed in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens, and are maintained by Exeter City Council.\nThe site was originally quarried in Roman times for stone for the city walls. The gardens incorporate a stretch of Roman wall and the only length of Saxon town wall to be seen in England. They form a crescent shape bounded to the north by the West of England Main Line and Exeter Central railway station, and to the south by the castle and Rougemont Gardens. Their eastern entrance is at the head of Northernhay Place and the gardens open on the west to Northernhay Gate.\n\nThe early park was destroyed in the Civil War, in 1642, when large defensive ditches were dug outside the walls for the city's defence. Soon after the Restoration, in 1664, the city set about restoring the park, planting hundreds of young elms and laying out gravel paths. There has been a tradition of maintaining the park as a major city amenity since that time.\n\nThe gardens underwent a major re-landscaping in 1860, and between 1860 and 1895 received an important group of monuments to major Victorian figures in the city's history. \"The Deer Stalker\" (1875) by E. B. Stephens (1815\u20131882), is a significant piece of Victorian art that was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1876. Stephens also sculpted the statues of John Dinham, who was a local philanthropist, and Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet, in the gardens.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries Northernhay Gardens were affectionately known by the familiar name \"Norney\".\n\nThe statue of the Conservative politician Stafford Northcote (1887) is by Joseph Boehm. The Volunteer Memorial (1895), designed by S. K. Greenslade, commemorates the formation of the 1st Rifle Volunteers in 1852, and the Exeter War Memorial by local sculptor John Angel was constructed in 1923. The gardens also contain a bandstand.\n\nIn the mid 1900s the mature avenue of elms lining the central walk succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease and were felled. Subsequent planting has sought to provide all-year-round colour and interest. The gardens offer views over large parts of the city, and events are hosted there throughout the year."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Northernhay Gardens", "description": "Public open space in Exeter, England", "types": ["Park", "Garden", "Historical site"]}, {"label": "Rougemont Castle", "description": "Historical castle in Exeter, England", "types": ["Castle", "Historical site"]}, {"label": "West of England Main Line", "description": "Railway line in England", "types": ["Railway", "Transportation"]}, {"label": "Exeter Central railway station", "description": "Railway station in Exeter, England", "types": ["Railway station", "Transportation"]}, {"label": "Roman wall", "description": "Ancient wall built by Romans", "types": ["Historical site", "Wall"]}, {"label": "Saxon town wall", "description": "Ancient wall built by Saxons", "types": ["Historical site", "Wall"]}, {"label": "E.

The magazine was published on a quarterly basis and had its headquarters in Toronto.\n\n\"Tamarack Review\" published literature in a wide variety of genres, including fiction, poetry, travel memoirs, autobiography, literary criticism and drama. However, the magazine also covered the best examples of contemporary poetry.\n\nIn 1962, an anthology of work collected from the \"Tamarack Review\" was published, entitled \"The First Five Years\". In the introduction, Robert Fulford gives a good picture of the role of the magazine in the early years. He claims that the founders of the magazine represented what was then Toronto's literary establishment. Their careers\u2014one poet, three publishing-house editors, one academic, and one CBC program organizer\u2014give an apt sense of what the literary establishment of the time was like. He continues:\n\nWe can assume that one of their purposes in starting the magazine was to stop talking almost exclusively to each other and begin addressing a somewhat larger world. Six years later it might seem, on the surface, that in this respect the \"Tamarack\" is a failure. It has never sold more than twelve hundred copies, and (except in some small, peculiar circles) has not become a fashionable magazine for coffee-table display. Nor is it profitable; editors, in fact, have had to make up its deficit out of their own pockets, and the Canada Council's steady assistance has now become almost a necessity of survival. But these facts are deceptive. The \"Tamarack\" has won, over the years, an influence that is, as they say, out of all proportion to its circulation. Poets send it their best poems, fiction writers offer it their best stories, critics labour for it with glad heart. Publishers read it, and so do magazine editors, and so do many of the most eminent citizens of the country. Only a contributor can know how true this is: one article I wrote for the \"Tamarack\" four years ago has been mentioned to me more often, and discussed more widely, than many piece I have written for publications which have a thousand times as many readers. \"Tamarack\" readers, I have learned, read carefully and remember well.\n\nNotable writers whose early work was published in \"Tamarack\" include Timothy Findley, Hugh Hood, Alice Munro, Jay Macpherson and Mordecai Richler."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Tamarack Review", "description": "A Canadian literary magazine published from 1956 to 1982", "types": ["Literary magazine", "Canadian literature"]}, {"label": "Robert Weaver", "description": "The founder and editor of Tamarack Review", "types": ["Editor", "Canadian literature"]}, {"label": "Anne Wilkinson", "description": "A figure associated with the editorial staff of Tamarack Review", "types": ["Editor", "Canadian literature"]}, {"label": "William Toye", "description": "A figure associated with the editorial staff of Tamarack Review", "types": ["Editor", "Canadian literature"]}, {"label": "John Robert Colombo", "description": "A figure associated with the editorial staff of Tamarack Review", "types": ["Editor", "Canadian literature"]}, {"label": "Ivon Maclean Owen", "description": "One of the founding editors of Tamarack Review", "types": ["Editor", "Canadian literature"]}, {"label": "F.R.

In 1942, he was murdered by the Nazis during the Occupation of France.\n\nBorn in Saint Petersburg, he left the USSR in 1922 at the end of the Civil War. He settled in Paris and studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV and the Sorbonne University. A pupil of French philosopher Victor Basch, he worked on aesthetics and wrote an essay, \"L'Esth\u00e9tique fran\u00e7aise contemporaine\" (\"French contemporan aesthetic\"), F\u00e9lix Alcan, 1936.\n\nInvolved in public activities as a teacher of philosophy, he supported as an antifascist the Front populaire and the Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War. He joined the French Communist Party in 1937. Among his friends were Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Gaston Bachelard and Georges Politzer. In September 1939, he volunteered for the French Army despite suffering from a heart condition. Mobilized as a soldier in Rethel, he began to write his \"Journal de guerre\" in January 1940 in the middle of the Phoney War. He survived several air attacks and bombardments during the Fall of France (May\u2013June 1940).\n\nUnder the German Occupation he was a teacher in Dieppe but suffered from the first French Statute on Jews (October 1940). He was finally excluded from teaching in July 1941. By that time, he was already active in the French Resistance. From 1940, he was liaison officer between Dieppe, Rouen and Paris. After a year, he wrote the texts against the collaborationist Vichy regime and the Germans in the clandestine newspaper \"L'Avenir normand\" in Dieppe, and wrote several texts for the clandestine Parisian review \"La Pens\u00e9e libre\", supervised by Georges Politzer, Jacques Decour and Jacques Solomon. Becoming part of the underground, he joined a group of communist Resistance in Rouen, where he participated in actions against the German occupiers.\n\nArrested in February 1942 after the sabotage of a factory, he was imprisoned and tortured. Judged in Paris, he was condemned to death by a German military tribunal. He refused to sign his appeal for a reprieve. Feldman was executed by a firing squad on 27 July 1942. Addressing the German soldiers just before the salvo, he called out to them: \"Imbeciles, it is for you that I die! \"\n\nHis last words inspired numerous French writers: Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Aragon were among them. French-Swiss film-maker Jean-Luc Godard dedicated a short film to him, \"The Last Word\" (1988).\n\nEssays :\n* \"L'Esth\u00e9tique fran\u00e7aise contemporaine\", Paris, F\u00e9lix Alcan, 1936.

{"id": "20334479", "uri": "Q6177321", "title": "Jen Smith", "text": "Jen Smith is an artist, musician, zine editor, and activist from the United States.\n\nJen Smith is credited with being the inspiration behind the term Riot Grrrl and being one of the architects of the movement. Writing in \"Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital\", Mark Andersen and Mark Jenkins report that while living in Washington, D.C., Smith reacted to the violence of the Mount Pleasant race riots in the Spring of 1991 by prophetically writing in a letter to Allison Wolfe, \"this summer's going to be a girl riot.\" Other reports say she wrote, \"we need to start a girl riot.\"\n\nThat summer, Olympia, Washington, students Wolfe and Molly Neuman, editors of \"Girl Germs\" zine, to which Smith had contributed, moved to Washington, D.C. Having already formed their band Bratmobile, they asked Smith and Christina Billotte (of Autoclave and Slant 6) to join, and the band released one cassette tape, called \"Bratmobile DC\", with this line-up.\n\nAs written about in \"Bikini Kill\" zine by Kathleen Hanna, Jen proposed they all collaborate on a zine called \"Girl Riot\", which would serve as a networking forum for young women. Molly Neuman began the zine, released under the title \"riot grrrl\", with contributions from Smith, Wolfe, and the members of Bikini Kill.\n\nAt the end of the summer Bratmobile returned to Olympia and Jen Smith stayed behind to edit a zine called \"Red Rover\". A number of issues were released before, in 1993, she began a new zine, an offshoot of \"Red Rover\", called \"Another Lo-Fi Xtravanganza\". The zine also became a small record label, releasing cassettes by artists such as Wandering Lucy.\n\nAt the same time, Smith began a band with Donna Dresch and Nikki Chapman called Rastro! The trio, with Smith on guitar and vocals, Chapman on bass, and Dresch on drums, released two songs on compilations by independent record labels such as Simple Machines. After this band broke up, Smith moved to Olympia, Washington where she recorded \"Boot Party\" with Dub Narcotic Sound System, and began the Cha Cha Cabaret, which she hosted under the persona of \"Miss Lady Hand Grenade\" in 1996 and 1997. Participating artists included Miranda July, Mirah, Flying Tigers, Old Time Relijun, Simplement Jacques, Nikki McClure, The Lookers, The Skirts, and Panties, and all appear together on the K Records compilation \"Chez Vous\". Cha Cha Cabaret toured the country, adding musicians such as Sharon Cheslow while in San Francisco.\n\nIn the 2000s, Smith returned to San Francisco, where she joined with ex-Circus Lupus member Seth Lorinczi and ex-Electrolettes member Julianna Bright to begin the band The Quails. The band toured with Sleater Kinney, Aislers Set and The No-No's. They released three CDs, as well as zines and projects such as the comic book \"Bon Soir\" and a mini-opera CD under the name 'Marzipan Ponce'.\n\nAfter this band broke up, Jen Smith devoted herself to her artwork. She has exhibited across the country, collaborating with artists such as LTTR, and having her own solo exhibitions.\n\nIn 2008, she appeared in the feature film \"The Lollipop Generation\" by G.B. Jones "}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Jen Smith", "description": "An artist, musician, zine editor, and activist from the United States.", "types": ["Person", "Activist", "Musician", "Artist"]}, {"label": "Riot Grrrl", "description": "A feminist punk movement that originated in the early 1990s.", "types": ["Music Genre", "Feminism"]}, {"label": "Mount Pleasant race riots", "description": "A series of riots that occurred in Washington, D.C. in the Spring of 1991.", "types": ["Event"]}, {"label": "Allison Wolfe", "description": "An American singer, songwriter, and activist.", "types": ["Person", "Activist", "Musician"]}, {"label": "Girl Germs", "description": "A zine created by Molly Neuman and Allison Wolfe.", "types": ["Zine"]}, {"label": "Bratmobile", "description": "An American punk band formed in 1991.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "Christina Billotte", "description": "An American musician and artist.", "types": ["Person", "Musician", "Artist"]}, {"label": "Bikini Kill", "description": "An American punk rock band formed in Olympia, Washington in October 1990.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "Kathleen Hanna", "description": "An American musician, artist, and feminist activist.", "types": ["Person", "Activist", "Musician", "Artist"]}, {"label": "Red Rover", "description": "A zine edited by Jen Smith.", "types": ["Zine"]}, {"label": "Another Lo-Fi Xtravanganza", "description": "A zine and record label created by Jen Smith.", "types": ["Zine", "Record Label"]}, {"label": "Wandering Lucy", "description": "An American indie rock band.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "Rastro!", "description": "An American punk band formed by Jen Smith, Donna Dresch, and Nikki Chapman.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "Simple Machines", "description": "An American independent record label.", "types": ["Record Label"]}, {"label": "Dub Narcotic Sound System", "description": "An American indie rock band.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "Cha Cha Cabaret", "description": "A touring cabaret show hosted by Jen Smith.", "types": ["Event", "Music"]}, {"label": "Miranda July", "description": "An American filmmaker, artist, and writer.", "types": ["Person", "Artist"]}, {"label": "Mirah", "description": "An American musician and songwriter.", "types": ["Person", "Musician"]}, {"label": "Flying Tigers", "description": "An American indie rock band.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "Old Time Relijun", "description": "An American experimental rock band.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "Simplement Jacques", "description": "An American indie rock band.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "Nikki McClure", "description": "An American artist and author.", "types": ["Person", "Artist"]}, {"label": "The Lookers", "description": "An American indie rock band.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "The Skirts", "description": "An American punk rock band.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "Panties", "description": "An American punk rock band.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "San Francisco", "description": "A city in California, United States.", "types": ["City"]}, {"label": "The Quails", "description": "An American indie rock band.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "Sleater Kinney", "description": "An American rock band formed in Olympia, Washington in 1994.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "Aislers Set", "description": "An American indie pop band.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "The No-No's", "description": "An American indie rock band.", "types": ["Band", "Music"]}, {"label": "Bon Soir", "description": "A comic book created by The Quails.", "types": ["Comic Book"]}, {"label": "Marzipan Ponce", "description": "A mini-opera CD created by The Quails.", "types": ["Music Album"]}, {"label": "Artwork", "description": "Visual art created by Jen Smith.", "types": ["Art"]}, {"label": "LTTR", "description": "An artist collective and queer feminist journal.", "types": ["Art Collective", "Feminism"]}, {"label": "The Lollipop Generation", "description": "A feature film directed by G.B.

Frank Redington was best known for his development of Immunisation Theory which specifies how a fixed income portfolio can be \"immunised\" against changing interest rates. \n\nRedington's work indirectly led to the development of Liability Driven Investment (LDI) techniques for corporate pension funds. Interest rate SWAPS and bond investment when combined with the use of inflation protection measures (e.g. Index Linked Gilts, SWAPS and similar derivative contracts), can help protect pension funds from funding volatility.\n\nThis was first adopted by a major pension fund in the UK in 1999/2000 when Boots the Chemist moved to virtually a 100% Government and corporate bond investment strategy, partly advised by its Corporate Finance Director, John Ralfe. This proved extremely well timed given the stock market crash of 2001 and up to a third of large pension schemes have subsequently adopted similar strategies, especially mature schemes that have closed to new members and future accruals. 'Marking to market' accounting standards that highlighted the risks being run by defined benefit (DB) pension schemes, together with more rigid regulation, solvency requirements, dividend tax, low interest rates and improving longevity, has all contributed to DB pension scheme decline in the private sector.\n\nThe antipathy to Redington's philosophy would be the 'cult of the equity' as championed by George Ross Goobey. Ross Goobey, as Imperial Tobacco's pension fund manager, first noticed that dividends from shares could rise over time and provide a real rate of return, albeit volatile and not certain. Long term investors could normally be expected to ride out the inevitable troughs and in the 1950s and 1960s most schemes adopted an equity strategy, alongside Gilts and bonds, as equities did deliver good (if variable) returns.\n\nFrank Redington was born in Leeds and attended Liverpool Institute for Boys, and Cambridge University. He joined the staff of the Prudential life insurance company in 1928 and became its Chief Actuary in 1951, continuing in that capacity until his retirement in 1968.\n\nHe was the Chairman of the Life Offices\u2019 Association from 1956\u20131957 and president of the Institute of Actuaries 1958\u20131960. In 2003, he was voted \"the greatest British actuary ever\" by readers of \"The Actuary\", the magazine for the actuarial profession."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Frank Mitchell Redington",

provided services overseas for American and international seafarers. USS's network of worldwide port centers offers seafarers two types of services:\n\n# Building-centered services which provide recreation, communications, counseling, food, beverages and gift shop and health articles; and outreach programs which bring USS services to seafarers on shipboard, in hospital or detention. Services include repatriation, hospital visits, detention serviceshelping seafarers in prison, legal assistance and communications services, with overseas phone, fax and mail facilities at the USS centers.\n# Ship-visiting and library services include staff visits to ships in port with information on local attractions, customs and culture and other required assistance. Fresh reading material, supplied by the USS affiliated American Merchant Marine Library Association, are brought to restock the ship's library.\n\nThere are currently 7 port centers open: Bremerhaven, Germany; Casablanca, Morocco; Diego Garcia, B.I.O.T.; Guam, M.I.; Naha, Okinawa, Japan; Pusan, Korea; and Yokohama, Japan. Many other centers existed during the years of World War II and thereafter, including centers in Naples and Genoa, Italy; Bandar Mahshahr, Iran; Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam; Alexandria, Egypt and Manila, Philippines.\n\nWhile the main charter of the USS is to serve merchant marine personnel, a large part of their clientele over the years has come from United States Navy and other international military personnel. As the constitution of merchant marine fleets changed over time, with many computerized supertankers requiring only a handful of crewmen to operate, and with military deployment adjustments, many centers were forced to close due to reduced patronage. As an example the center in Naples, Italy was heavily dependent on personnel from the United States Sixth Fleet; during the 1970s, aircraft carriers (such as the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67), destroyer tenders (such as the USS Grand Canyon (AD-28) and USS Cascade (AD-16), as well as myriad destroyers and patrol gunboats made Naples their home, and sailors found the USS facilities another home away from home.\n\nThe U.S. Military has long cooperated with the United Seamen's Service in a number of ways. DoD Directive 1330.16, issued July 10, 1971 (now cancelled) provided for policies, procedures, and responsibilities governing DoD cooperation with and assistance to the United Seamen's Service (USS) under Title 10, United States Code, Section 2604.\n\nEach year the USS confers its AOTOS (Admiral of the Ocean Sea) award upon individuals who have made significant contributions to maritime commerce.\n\nThe USS is a part of the Global Impact Coalition, which contains 55 of the most respected charities in the world."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "United Seamen's Service",

{"doc": {"id": "846084", "uri": "Q1204366", "title": "A Room of One's Own", "text": "A Room of One's Own is an extended essay by Virginia Woolf, first published in September 1929. The work is based on two lectures Woolf delivered in October 1928 at Newnham College and Girton College, women's constituent colleges at the University of Cambridge.\n\nAn important feminist text, the essay argues for both a literal and figurative space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by men.\n\nIn her essay, Woolf uses metaphors to explore social injustices and comments on women\u2019s lack of free expression. Her metaphor of a fish explains her most essential point, \u201cA woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\u201d. She writes of a woman whose thought had \u201clet its line down into the stream\u201d. As the woman starts to think of an idea, a guard enforces a rule whereby women are not allowed to walk on the grass. Abiding by the rule, the women loses her idea. Here, Woolf describes the influence of women's social expectations as mere domestic child bearers, ignorant and chaste. The control of literature has been granted to men as a consequence of this patriarchal domination. \n\nThe political meaning of the text is directly linked to this metaphor. When the emergence of the 'new woman' occurred, this awareness of injustice makes a clear political statement regarding women's intellectual potential in their own right. Therefore, the broader literary influence of this argument reveals the increase in social tension as the century's shift looms. Woolf suggests that the absence of female fiction is a result of a lack of opportunity rather than a distinct absence of talent.\n\nThe association between poverty and low achievement can also lead to disadvantages for generations. Much as women have been for decades marginalized and the patriarchy dominated literature, Woolf's general theory can be extended to many political circumstances. In this case, children are extremely conscious of their social status and thus aware of their own possibilities or absence, similar to the 'fish' metaphor in which women were aware of their position and lost their 'thinking'. It helps us to see how social problems shift shape, but the absence of opportunity still causes isolation and inequality. In this context, Woolf's work is seen as a political argument with direct applications in the real world. As the narrative lies inbetween, it enables society to use the general thesis of \"A Room of One\u2019s Own\" to reference injustice of all kinds to many contemporary social issues. In conclusion, this wise applicability reveals the true importance of the political literary contribution of Woolf.

He was a representative of Mashhad in the Majlis of Iran from 2000 to 2004.\n\nBorn in Mashhad in a religious family, he studied Islamic sciences in Mashhad and then moved to Qom to continue his studies there. Because of his religious-political speeches, he was arrested by the Pahlavi government twice, the first time in 1972 when he was sentenced to a short jail time. But the second time, in 1973, he was exiled to Bandar Deylam and Nain for three years. Abaee-Khorasani restarted his political speeches in 1976, with other cleric colleagues of his, specially Sadegh Khalkhali, Mehdi Karroubi, and Mohammad Mousavi-Khoiniha.\n\nAfter the Iranian Revolution, Abaee-Khorasani's first governmental post was the Sharia ruler in Ahwaz. Shortly after, he moved back to Qom to head the provincial branch of the Organization for Islamic Evangelization (\"saazmaan-e tablighaat-e eslaami\"), which sent clerics to the whole country for speeches during the holy Shi'a months of Muharram, Safar, and Ramadan, and also published periodicals, which sometimes contained critiques of extremist or conservative factions of the \"hawza\".\n\nWhile keeping the position in Qom, Abaee-Khorasani moved to Mashhad and was one of the Friday prayer Imams of the city for ten years, where he escaped an unsuccessful assassination attempt in 1994. He also represented the Khorasan province in the first Assembly of Experts.\n\nAbaee-Khorasani moved to Qom again as the head of Mohammad Khatami's presidential campaign office in the city of Qom. The Qom campaign led to about 70% of the people of the city voting for the reformist Khatami, which was unexpected because of the supposedly conservative leanings of the citizens of the city. The local campaign team later became the founding members of the Society of Scholars and Teachers of Qom's Hawza (\"majma'-e mohaghgheghin va modarresin-e howze-ye elmiyye-ye ghom\"), the political organization of reformist clerics of the city.\n\nWhen Khatami became president in 1997, he appointed Abaee-Khorasani as one of his advisors. Later, he was elected in 2000 in the parliamentary elections to represent the city of Mashhad, his birthplace, in the Majlis of Iran. He collected the most votes in the city. During his term there, he participated in the reformist candidates' sit-in in early 2004, amid his old blood and kidney disease. He also participated in the symbolic mass resignation of more than a hundred colleagues from the sixth \"Islamic Consultative Assembly\".\n\nAfter a long physical illness, Abaee-Khorasani died on October 13, 2004 in the Khatam ol-Anbia Hospital. On October 16, he was buried in Qom, near the shrine of Fatima bint Musa ibn Jafar, the daughter of the seventh Shia Imam."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Ayatollah Mohammad Va'ez Abaee-Khorasani",

Carrera and his 77 men of the Fourth Company of Chacabuco are regarded in Chile as great heroes, and are commonly referred to as the \"H\u00e9roes de la Concepci\u00f3n\", after all were killed in the Battle of La Concepci\u00f3n.\n\nCarrera was born in Santiago, Chile; the son of Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera Fontecilla, of Basque descent, and of Emilia Pinto Benavente. He was the grandson of Jose Miguel Carrera Verdugo, one of Chile's independence heroes. He was also the great-grandson and great-nephew of Chile's Presidents Francisco Antonio Pinto and An\u00edbal Pinto. When the War of the Pacific, between Chile, on one side, and Peru and Bolivia on the other, started in 1879, Carrera Pinto enlisted in the Chilean Army's 7th Mobilized Infantry Regimentthe \"Esmeralda\" regiment. Over the next few years, Carrera's accomplishments and personal merits resulted in a rapid series of promotions, becoming a lieutenant in 1881 and a captain in 1882. He participated in the Lima Campaign and in the Sierra Campaign.\n\n In July 1882, during the Sierra Campaign, Captain Carrera was in command of the Esmeralda's Fourth Company of Chacabuco, which was guarding the Peruvian town of La Concepci\u00f3n. Including officers, Fourth Company totaled 77 soldiers, divided into three platoons under lieutenants Julio Montt Salamanca, Luis Cruz Mart\u00ednez and Arturo Perez Canto. On July 10, 1882, in the Battle of La Concepci\u00f3n, the town was attacked by 400 regular Peruvian soldiers and large groups of natives, which were part of the forces of Andr\u00e9s C\u00e1ceres, a Peruvian officer who was conducting a guerrilla war. Despite being greatly outnumbered and out of ammunition, the Chilean soldiers did not surrender. The last Chilean soldiers died charging the well-armed Peruvian army with only their bayonets.\n\nThe Carrera family was one of Chile's most influential families and grew considerably in number. Today, the bulk of the family remains in Santiago and the southern Province of the Bio Bio, although a portion is known to have emigrated to Sweden.\n\nThe Chilean one thousand peso banknote bears

"VeloBind", "text": "VeloBind is a type of book binding often offered at copy and print shops. Velobinding involves punching several small holes along the edge of an unbound book. A strip of plastic with rigid tines is inserted into the holes from the top of the book, and a strip with corresponding holes is placed on the back with the tines protruding through. The book is then placed in a machine that holds the book tightly while the excess length of the tines is cut and the tips melted to seal the bind. The term \"VeloBind\" is a trademark of the General Binding Corporation, but is regularly used generically to refer to this process, though strip binding is also sometimes used.\n\nThough velobinding is intended to be permanent, the binding can be carefully removed using a utility knife or the special cutting tool included with the binding machine.\n\nHardcover books can be created using the VeloBind process. Two adhesive inner covers are bound with the prospective contents. These adhesive pages are applied to the inside of a paperboard hard case, itself decoratively covered and containing an adhesive strip that matches with the spine. Book information can be embossed onto the cover with a contrasting . VeloBind hardcovers are often used to preserve theses and dissertations.\n\nIt is possible to take a soft covered Velo-bound book, remove the old binding and cover, and re-bind it with a hard cover, which may be pre-embossed for more a more impressive appearance. This rapid up-grade was the cause of the short-lived motto \"Soft to hard in 30 seconds!\" \nThat was first done when the firm was located in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nThere are a number of different styles of Velobind that are available from GBC. The most common style of Velobind strips have eleven pins that are equally spaced across the spine. This style of strips is used by a hot knife binding machine such as the GBC V800pro, Velobind System 2 or Velobind System Three Pro. All of those machines use a heated knife to permanently weld documents in place.\n\nOther styles of Velobind binding strips include four pin reclosable strips and six pin reclosable strips. Four pin Velobind strips are designed for use with either an eleven hole pattern or with a four hole pattern. Six pin strips are designed for use with the personal velobinder which has now been discontinued. Both of these styles of strips allow users to edit their documents by simply snapping the excess portion of the pins into the back of the receiving strip.\n\nOne other style of GBC Velobind strips is the 111 or One-Eleven binding strips. The style uses a strip with serrated pins. The machine compresses the spine together locking the pages in place and then cuts the excess portion of the pins off to finish the document. The GBC 111 Velobind machine has been discontinued for many years and the supplies for this binding style are becoming difficult to find."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "VeloBind", "description":

The tale, slightly revised, was included in his short story collection \"The Piazza Tales\" that appeared in May 1856. According to scholar Merton M. Sealts Jr., the story is \"an oblique comment on those prevailing attitudes toward blacks and slavery in the United States that would ultimately precipitate civil war between North and South\". The famous question of what had cast such a shadow upon Cereno was used by American author Ralph Ellison as an epigraph to his 1952 novel \"Invisible Man\", excluding Cereno's answer, \"The negro.\" Over time, Melville's story has been \"increasingly recognized as among his greatest achievements\".\n\nIn 1799 off the coast of Chile, captain Amasa Delano of the American sealer and merchant ship \"Bachelor's Delight\" visits the \"San Dominick\", a Spanish slave ship apparently in distress. After learning from its captain Benito Cereno that a storm has taken many crewmembers and provisions, Delano offers to help out. He notices that Cereno acts awkwardly passive for a captain and the slaves display remarkably inappropriate behavior, and though this piques his suspicion he ultimately decides he is being paranoid. When he leaves the \"San Dominick\" and captain Cereno jumps after him, he finally discovers that the slaves have taken command of the ship, and forced the surviving crew to act as usual. Employing a third-person narrator who reports Delano's point of view without any correction, the story has become a famous example of unreliable narration.\n\nMuch critical study has gone into the story's relation to the Toussaint Louverture-led slave rebellion of the 1790s in Saint-Domingue, as well as to Melville's use of one chapter from the historical Amasa Delano's \"Voyages\" of 1817, a source of such importance that \"he must have written 'Benito Cereno' with Chapter 18 constantly open before him.\" The novella's \"unreliable, even deceptive, narration\" continues to cause misunderstanding. Many reviewers of \"The Piazza Tales\" cited the novella as one of the highlights in the collection.

After Riku matriculated in 1991 at Ho\u00ebrskool Florida, Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, he studied philosophy at University of the Witwatersrand where he finished his honours degree. He changed his name to Victor S. Wolf and claimed that Riku Latti is \"dead\". Since then he composed the complete film score for Jans Rautenbach's film \"Abraham\" on which he was credited as Riku L\u00e4tti, thereby being effectively resurrected.\n\nIn South Africa Riku collaborated with superstars such as Koos Kombuis, Laurika Rauch, Frazer Barry, Churchil Naud\u00e9, David Kramer, Stef Bos, Paul Riekert among others. His songs have been performed and recorded by people like Karla du Plessis, Laurika Rauch, Bobby van Jaarsveld, the all-girl punk band The Pheobes and the jazz outfit Tsunami and Izak Davel.\n\nIn 2005, he broke onto the international music scene when he completed his first tour in Belgium and the Netherlands. In 2006 during a follow-up tour through Europe he performed with Stef Bos. On October 1, 2007, L\u00e4tti releases his first album in the Benelux (Akoesties). For this album he re-recorded some of his best songs in a stripped-down version, using only his voice and a piano or a guitar.\n\nRiku together with Jahn Beukes wrote the music for the award-winning SABC television series \"Hopeville\". \"Hopeville\" won the prestigious Rose d'Or in Switzerland for best international TV series. It was also nominated for an Emmy Award. Other scores include the soundtrack for KykNet series \"Wie l\u00ea waar\" and the drama series \"Vlug na Egipte\".\n\nHe won a South African Film and Television Award (SAFTA) for his sound design and film score for the feature film \"Die Wonderlike Avonture van Hanna Hoekom\".\n\nOther awards Riku has won include 2 GMT (Geraas Musiektoekennings). (The first for best Alternative Artist for his album \"Pleister vir my Nerwe\". The second for best male vocalist for his album \"Aan't sterre tel\".) And a Vonk Music award for his album \"Die President se keuse\".\n\nHis greatest work before his death was a collaborative album \"Radio Lava\" with Jahn Beukes and Arnaud van Vliet featuring original work from Huyser Burger.\n\nIn his last act before his death he accused the South African media of not having transformed after the end of Apartheid.\n\nHe is also the chief in charge of \"zimdollar\", an Afrikaans cult newspaper.\n\nThere is also a Finnish pop singer of the same name."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Riku L\u00e4tti", "description": "South African singer, songwriter and writer", "types": ["Musician", "Songwriter", "Writer"]}, {"label": "Ho\u00ebrskool Florida", "description": "High school in Johannesburg", "types": ["Educational Institution"]}, {"label": "University of the Witwatersrand", "description": "University in Johannesburg", "types": ["Educational Institution"]}, {"label": "Victor S.

Spanish Republic. In this period he worked as a lawyer and a legal adviser to the Bank of Spain in Valencia. He also studied journalism in the early 1930s, writing numerous articles, and subsequently helped to found the Spanish Export Bank. By the 1960s he had become Deacon of the Spanish College of Lawyers.\n\nFollowing the end of the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. He then became founder and President of the Valencian People's Party and Vice-President of the federation of People's Parties. That party, not to be confused with the current grouping of the same name, joined with other parties to form the Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD) in 1977. As a UCD member, at the 1977 General Election, he was elected to the Spanish Congress of Deputies representing Valencia Province and was re-elected in the subsequent election in 1979.\n\nA distinguished lawyer, during the Spanish transition to democracy Attard was chosen as President of the parliamentary commission charged with editing the new Spanish constitution. Along with the other six members of the Constitutional Commission he was subsequently awarded the Grand Cross of Alonso X by the King Juan Carlos I Within the UCD, he served as Vice-President of the UCD parliamentary group in Congress as well as serving on the UCD national executive and the Valencian regional executive. He was also one of the Vice-Presidents of the Congress.\n\nThe late 1970s in Valencia saw a dispute over the Valencian Statute of Autonomy, a period which became known as the \"Battle of Valencia\" () During this period Attard was a major figure in organising anti-Catalan groups as a political tactic for the UCD. However he was credited with coining the name of the Valencian Community (), a compromise between the UCD's preferred \"Kingdom of Valencia\" () and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party's (PSOE) preferred \"Valencian Country\" () He left the executive of the UCD in May 1981 and four years later resigned from the Council of State in protest at the naming of the former PSOE minister Tom\u00e1s de la Cuadra Salcedo as President of that body.\n\nIn his later years he dedicated himself to his legal work. Besides this, he worked as Professor of Political rights at the University of Valencia. He also became President of the Constitutional Council of the Generalitat Valenciana, the Valencian Regional government in 1996 and authored numerous books, many of them on Spanish Constitutionalism and political history."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Emilio Attard Alonso", "description": "Spanish politician and distinguished lawyer", "types": ["Politician", "Lawyer", "Journalist",

The American Pit Bull Terrier varies in size: males are normally about 18\u201321 inches (45\u201353\u00a0cm) in height and around 35\u201360 pounds (15\u201327\u00a0kg) in weight, while females are normally around 17\u201320 inches (43\u201350\u00a0cm) in height and 30\u201350 pounds (13\u201322\u00a0kg) in weight.\n\nAccording to the ADBA, the American Pit Bull is prescribed to be medium-sized and has a short coat and smooth well-defined muscle structure, and its eyes are to be round to almond-shaped, and its ears are to be small to medium in length, typically half prick or rose in carriage. The tail is prescribed to be slightly thick and tapering to a point. The coat is required by the ADBA to be glossy, smooth, short, and stiff to the touch. Many colors, color patterns, and combinations of colors are acceptable to the ADBA, except that both the ADBA and UKC do not recognize merle coloring. Color patterns that are typical in the breed are solid and tuxedo.\n\nDespite the colloquial use of the term \"pit bull\" to encompass a whole category of dogs and the legal use of the term to include several breeds in legislation, some conservative professional breeders of the American Pit Bull Terrier as well as some experts and supporters claim that historically the APBT is the only true \"pit bull\" and the only breed that should be denominated as such.\n\nTwelve countries in Europe, as well as Australia, Canada, the United States, Ecuador, Malaysia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and Venezuela, have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on pit bull\u2013type dogs, including American Pit Bull Terriers, ranging from outright bans to restrictions and conditions on ownership. The state of New South Wales in Australia places restrictions on the breed, including mandatory sterilization. The breed is banned in the United Kingdom, in the Canadian province of Ontario, and in many locations in the United States."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "American Pit Bull Terrier",

of New Zealand as a nation, the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, 1000 years of known human habitation of New Zealand, and the 75th anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli. \n\nThe Commission was initially made up of 12 persons and the Minister of Internal Affairs, with the Minister as chairperson. Michael Bassett (the minister) appointed Don Hutchings to the position of CEO of the commission. Four regional offices were established in Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington and Dunedin.In order to fulfil its statutory functions the Commission had two major roles, that of an advisory body, and the body responsible for the distribution of funds for 1990 celebrations. There was an initiative to diversify New Zealand's imagery such as using the kotuku (white heron) instead of the kiwi or silver fern as its logo.\n\nCommittees were formed throughout New Zealand based on the then existing local boundary authorities. Community groups, organisations and individuals wishing to organise 1990 events worked with these committees who in turn liaised with the nearest 1990 office - Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington or Dunedin.\n\nThe New Zealand 1990 Commission encouraged participation and involvement of many New Zealanders in the 1990 celebrations. In doing so the Commission hoped to:\n\n*increase the understanding and awareness of the Treaty of Waitangi\n*increase awareness and understanding of alternative points of view and differing cultural backgrounds\n*to encourage planning and thinking for the next 50 years to lay a better foundation for the future\n\nThe Wellington office also had responsibility for advertising and communications for the New Zealand 1990 Commission. This included the coverage of events such as Queen Elizabeth II attending the 1990 celebrations at Waitangi, and television campaigns covering other celebratory events. The events began on New Year's Day 1990 with televised coverage of a dawn ceremony of a waka welcomed into Gisborne accompanied by signing from Kiri te Kanawa. In February the successful launch was followed by the disastrous Sesqui 1990 fair in Wellington that shut down after just two weeks due to a lack of attendance with debts exceeding NZ$6.4 million.\n\nThe impact of the 1990 celebrations mostly were not lasting. However the first volume of the \"Dictionary of New Zealand Biography\" was launched (despite not initially being planned as a 1990 commemoration project) and an oral history project was started after a financial contribution from the Australian government. The New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame proved so popular however that it was made permanent. Initially based in Wellington it has been in Dunedin since 1999 and still uses the 1990 Commission logo in its branding."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "New Zealand 1990 Commission", "description": "A commission established to celebrate the 150th anniversary of New Zealand as a nation, the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, 1000 years of known human habitation of New Zealand, and the 75th anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli.", "types": ["Organization", "Government agency"]}, {"label": "Treaty of Waitangi", "description": "A treaty signed between the M\u0101ori chiefs and the British Crown in 1840, which is considered New Zealand's founding document.", "types": ["Historical document"]}, {"label": "Don Hutchings", "description": "The CEO of the New Zealand 1990 Commission appointed by Michael Bassett.", "types": ["Person", "CEO"]}, {"label": "Kotuku", "description": "A white heron used as an alternative symbol for New Zealand during the 1990 celebrations.", "types": ["Animal", "Symbol"]}, {"label": "Silver fern", "description": "A fern used as a symbol for New Zealand.", "types": ["Plant", "Symbol"]}, {"label": "Community groups", "description": "Groups of people who worked with the committees formed throughout New Zealand to organize 1990 events.", "types": ["Social group"]}, {"label": "Committees", "description": "Groups formed throughout New Zealand based on the then existing local boundary authorities to organize 1990 events.", "types": ["Organization"]}, {"label": "Queen Elizabeth II", "description": "The Queen of England who attended the 1990 celebrations at Waitangi.", "types": ["Person", "Royalty"]}, {"label": "Dictionary of New Zealand Biography", "description": "A biographical reference work containing information on notable New Zealanders.

He retired on account of superannuation in 2014 following which the Church of South India Synod headquartered in Chennai appointed a successor to him in 2015.\n\nAfter discerning his avocation towards priesthood, Surya Prakash entered the portals of a Protestant Seminary in 1972 in Bangalore where he studied spirituality leading to the award of the graduate degree of Bachelor of Divinity in 1976 after which he began pastoring parishes within the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Medak, Church of South India. In 1980, Surya Prakash went on to major in Greek and New Testament and became a member of the Society for Biblical Studies, India in which his Professor, J. G. F. Collison was already a distinguished member. Again from 1982, Surya Prakash continued to pastor parishes of the Diocese of Medak until Victor Premasagar sent him for doctoral studies in 1987 to the Kirchliche Hochschule, Bethel, Bielefeld, Germany where researched on Homiletics specializing in indigenous movements and Churches in India, especially the work of Sadhu Sundar Singh. Roger E. Hedlund, the Missiologist with major contribution to indigenous Christianity in India terms Surya Prakash as a leading authority on Sadhu Sundar Singh.\n\nFrom 1991 onwards, Surya Prakash spent nearly a decade teaching Homiletics at the United Theological College, Bangalore, an autonomous College affiliated to the Senate of Serampore College (University) until 2000 when he went to Stuttgart as India Liaison Secretary of the EMS succeeding Luise Plock who bridged the gap after C. L. Furtado. After a distinguished record at Stuttgart, Surya Prakash returned to India in 2005 donning the role of a Presbyter at the Diocese of Medak until his elevation to the Bishopric in 2007 in the adjoining Diocese of Karimnagar to succeed the Old Testament Scholar and Bishop S. J. Theodore who retired on attaining superannuation.\n\nSurya Prakash contributed as an academician and as an administrator to the Church taking into consideration not only the mainline Churches but the small and indigenous Churches in India as well. In 2006, India's first University \"(a University under Section 2 (f) of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956)\"with degree-granting authority validated by a Danish Charter and ratified by the Government of West Bengal elected Surya Prakash as a Member of its Council in which Surya Prakash continues to contribute to theological education and research.

The language has some recognition mainly in Brazil. It is an integral part of the historical and cultural heritage of Rio Grande do Sul since 2012, and is considered an immaterial cultural heritage of Santa Catarina since 2016. It is also a co-official language in the municipalities of Ant\u00f4nio Carlos, Santa Maria do Herval and S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o do Oeste. In Brazil, Hunsrik is spoken in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paran\u00e1. The language is also spoken in some regions of northeastern Argentina and southern Paraguay.\n\nHunsrik developed from the Hunsr\u00fcckisch dialect when immigrants from the Hunsr\u00fcck region of Germany (Rhineland-Palatinate) settled in southern regions such as Rio Grande do Sul, starting by imperial designs in 1824 (these later became projects controlled by states and finally by private European investment enterprises).\n\nWhile primarily based on the Hunsr\u00fcckisch branch of the German language, it has also been greatly influenced by other German dialects such as East Pomeranian and Plautdietsch, and by Portuguese, the national language of Brazil. It has been influenced to a lesser extent by indigenous languages such as Kaingang and Guarani and by immigrant languages such as Italian and Talian.\n\nPortuguese expressions and words are commonly imported into Hunsrik, particularly in reference to fauna and flora (which are different from those of Germany) and to technological innovations that did not exist when the original immigrants came to Brazil, leading to words like for airplane (Portuguese ) instead of , (Pt. , truck) instead of , (Pt. ) instead of , etc. Daily expressions are often calques (literal translations) of Portuguese, for example (\"how are you\", literally \"all good\") is from Portuguese .\n\nAlso common are the use of German suffixes attached to Portuguese words, such as , \"little mug\", from Portuguese , \"mug\", and German diminutive suffix ( in Hunsrik); hybrid forms such as , \"shoe shop\", from German and Portuguese , and Germanized forms of Portuguese verbs: , \"to remember\"; \"to flirt\"; , \"to answer\" (Portuguese , , and ). However, regardless of these borrowings, its grammar and vocabulary are still largely German.\n\nAlthough Hunsrik is the most common Germanic language in south Brazil, the use of this language\u2014particularly in the last three to four generations\u2014continues to decrease.

In 2014 the events were between 13-26/August.\n\nThe competition consists of two categories: \"Tango de Pista\" (Salon Tango), which has strict rules about the usage of traditional milonga figures, and \"Tango Escenario\" (Stage Tango), which is more choreographic and includes elements from other dance disciplines, such as ballet. Previously the competition was only open to couples consisting of men and women but in 2013 the rules were relaxed to allow same gender couples (man dancing with man, or woman with woman) to enter the competition.\n\nThe World Cup competition is the final leg of a series of pre-competitions held around the world starting from March. Traditionally the city of Buenos Aires and various municipalities choose their own \"Municipal\" champions who get wildcards into the final rounds. The same wildcard advantage is also given to national or regional champions of recognized competitions; These include Uruguay (UY), Chile (Cali, CL), Colombia (Bogota, CO), Brazil (Rio de Janeiro, BR), USA (San Francisco, US), Russia (Moscow, RU), China (Nanjing, CN), Japan (Tokyo, JP), Korea (Seoul, KR), France (Paris, FR), United Kingdom (London, UK), EU (Campeonato Europeo, Italy).\n\nNew municipalities in 2016: Turkey and the region (Istanbul, TR).\n\nThe first edition of the \"Mundial de Tango\" competition was held in 2003.\n\nA closely related and highly influential event is the Buenos Aires City competition. The competition rules state that members of the couple must both have \"DNI\" (i.e. have a resident status of 2 years or more) in Argentina. The competition may be considered somewhat even more demanding because the participants can compete in several dance categories: either Tango Senior (age 40 or older) or Tango Adulto (age 18-39) plus Vals or Milonga. Only couples \"Carlos Estigarribia\" & \"Mar\u00eda Laura Sastr\u00eda\" (2015) and \"Jimena Hoffner\" & \"Fernando Carrasco\" (2008), have won the triple championship. The winners of the tango categories are granted direct access to the final qualifying round in \"Mundial de Tango\". Couples in positions 2 through 5 are granted direct access to the semifinals in \"Mundial de Tango\". These couples represent the city of Buenos Aires in the world cup. The City competition's winners and runners-up are likely to become highly regarded and sought out teachers worldwide.\n\nWorth mentioning is the \"Campeonato inter milongas\" (CIM). In 2015 the milongas of Buenos Aires (El Fulgor de Villa Crespo, Sal\u00f3n Canning, Sal\u00f3n El Pial, Club Sunderland, Club Ciencia y Labor) started arranging monthly competitions whose final culminate in December. There are no restrictions in nationality or residence status of Argentina for the participants. The two monthly winning couples are voted for qualifying rounds and final by the audience and not selected judges."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "World Tango Dance Tournament", "description": "An annual competition of Argentine Tango held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, consisting of two categories: \"Tango de Pista\" and \"Tango Escenario\".", "types": ["Competition", "Dance"]}, {"label": "Tango de Pista", "description": "Also known as Salon Tango, it is a category in the World Tango Dance Tournament that has strict rules about the usage of traditional milonga figures.", "types": ["Dance"]}, {"label": "Tango Escenario", "description": "A category in the World Tango Dance Tournament that is more choreographic and includes elements from other dance disciplines, such as ballet.", "types": ["Dance"]}, {"label": "Buenos Aires Tango Festival", "description": "The festival organized by the city's government that includes the World Tango Dance Tournament.", "types": ["Festival"]}, {"label": "Municipal Champions", "description": "Winners of pre-competitions held around the world who get wildcards into the final rounds of the World Tango Dance Tournament.", "types": ["Competition"]}, {"label": "DNI", "description": "A resident status of 2 years or more in Argentina required to participate in the Buenos Aires City competition.", "types": ["Legal"]}, {"label": "Buenos Aires City Competition", "description": "A highly demanding competition that participants can compete in several dance categories: either Tango Senior or Tango Adulto plus Vals or Milonga.", "types": ["Competition", "Dance"]}, {"label": "Campeonato inter milongas CIM", "description": "Monthly competitions held in Buenos Aires whose final culminates in December, with no restrictions in nationality or residence status of Argentina for the participants.", "types": ["Competition", "Dance"]}], "gold": [{"uri": "Q25116", "boundaries": [148, 163], "surfaceform": "Argentine Tango", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q1486", "boundaries": [173, 185], "surfaceform": "Buenos Aires", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q414", "boundaries": [187, 196], "surfaceform": "Argentina", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "None", "boundaries": [232, 259], "surfaceform": "Buenos Aires Tango Festival", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q6860415", "boundaries": [473, 480], "surfaceform": "milonga", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q41425", "boundaries": [615, 621], "surfaceform": "ballet", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "Q8036679", "boundaries": [4, 32], "surfaceform": "World tango dance tournament", "annotator": "Me"}, {"uri": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime", "boundaries": [299, 303], "surfaceform": "2014", "annotator": "Date_Linker"}, {"uri": "2013-01-01T00:00:00Z^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime", "boundaries": [710, 714], "surfaceform": "2013", "annotator": "Date_Linker"}, {"uri": "2016-01-01T00:00:00Z^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime", "boundaries": [1513, 1517], "surfaceform": "2016", "annotator": "Date_Linker"}, {"uri": "2003-01-01T00:00:00Z^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime", "boundaries": [1626, 1630], "surfaceform": "2003", "annotator": "Date_Linker"}, {"uri": "2015-01-01T00:00:00Z^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime", "boundaries": [2688, 2692], "surfaceform": "2015", "annotator": "Date_Linker"}, {"uri": "+13^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [328, 330], "surfaceform": "13", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}, {"uri": "-26^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [330, 333], "surfaceform": "-26", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}, {"uri": "+2^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [1826, 1827], "surfaceform": "2", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}, {"uri": "+40^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [2011, 2013], "surfaceform": "40", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}, {"uri": "+18^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [2045, 2047], "surfaceform": "18", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}, {"uri": "-39^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [2047, 2050], "surfaceform": "-39", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}, {"uri": "+2015^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [2134, 2138], "surfaceform": "2015", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}, {"uri": "+2008^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [2184, 2188], "surfaceform": "2008", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}, {"uri": "+2^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [2361, 2362], "surfaceform": "2", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}, {"uri": "+5^^http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal", "boundaries": [2371, 2372], "surfaceform": "5", "annotator": "Value_Linker"}]}, "triples": {"gpt": [{"subject label": "World Tango Dance Tournament", "predicate label": "consists of", "predicate description": "expresses the composition of a set or group, indicating that the subject is made up of the objects mentioned in the triplets.

She was recognized as one of the Righteous Among the Nations for rescuing Jewish people from the Kaunas Ghetto during the Holocaust.\n\nLastien\u0117 was born in (Marijampol\u0117 Municipality) of the Suwa\u0142ki Governorate. She was a childhood friend with Ona Matulaityt\u0117, the future wife of Aleksandras Stulginskis. In 1914, she graduated from the Russian-language Girl's Gymnasium in Marijampol\u0117 and went on to complete nursing courses. From July 1915 to September 1916, she was a nurse with the 10th Army in the present-day Belarus. In Moscow, she completed four semesters at the history and philology section of the Poltoratskaya's Higher Courses for Women (). In 1918, she returned to Lithuania and became a teacher of history, geography, and Russian language in Marijampol\u0117. She married poet . In 1923, she moved to Kaunas where she taught at a gymnasium for adults while studying at the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Kaunas. From 1929 to 1940, she was an editor of \"Vadov\u0117\" journal for girl scout leaders. In 1938, she became teacher of history at the Kaunas 5th Gymnasium where she was promoted to headmistress after the Soviet occupation of Lithuania. During the Nazi occupation of Lithuania, Lastien\u0117 hid several Jews, including her former student Tamara Lazerson, from Nazi persecution. Yad Vashem recognized her as one of the Righteous Among the Nations in 2000.\n\nAfter the return of the Soviet regime in mid-1944, Lastien\u0117 briefly taught at the University of Kaunas and organized courses for workers and farmers. Together with Tadas Petkevi\u010dius and three others, she authored a memorandum addressed to Western powers on the Soviet occupation and worked with Petras Klimas to have it translated to French and smuggled abroad. For this, she was arrested in autumn 1945, convicted of counter-revolutionary activities, and sentenced to eight years in Gulag and five years in forced settlements. She was sent to the in the Komi ASSR where she worked as a nurse at the camp's hospital. She returned to Lithuania in 1953, after the death of Joseph Stalin. As a former political prisoner, she faced difficulties in finding employment, but her former student now rector of Kaunas Polytechnic Institute Kazimieras Bar\u0161auskas managed to get permission from First Secretary Antanas Snie\u010dkus to employ her as a professor. She was prohibited from teaching history and instead taught the Russian language. She worked at the institute from autumn 1955 to retirement in 1963. Vilnius University Library stores a personal collection of her documents (Fond 161).\n\nLastien\u0117 also translated and published several fiction works: the play \"Inno del primo maggio\" by Pietro Gori (1920), the comedy \"The Wood Demon\" by Anton Chekhov (1921), the play \"Autumn Violin\" by (1922), and the novel \"Nomads of the North\" by James Oliver Curwood (1937). She also translated two history textbooks, \"History of the Middle Ages\" (1923) and \"History of the Modern Ages\" (1925) by Robert Wipper."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Petron\u0117l\u0117

As per Indian government population census of 2011, Mumbai was the most populous city in India with an estimated city proper population of 12.5\u00a0million living under Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. Mumbai is the centre of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the sixth most populous metropolitan area in the world with a population of over 23\u00a0million. Mumbai lies on the Konkan coast on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour. In 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world city. It has the highest number of millionaires and billionaires among all cities in India. Mumbai is home to three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Elephanta Caves, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, and the city's distinctive ensemble of Victorian and Art Deco buildings.\n\nThe seven islands that constitute Mumbai were originally home to communities of Marathi language speaking Koli people. For centuries, the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea. Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.\n\nMumbai is the financial, commercial, and the entertainment capital of India. It is also one of the world's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow, generating 6.16% of India's GDP, and accounting for 25% of industrial output, 70% of maritime trade in India (Mumbai Port Trust and JNPT), and 70% of capital transactions to India's economy. Mumbai has the eighth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world, and Mumbai's billionaires had the highest average wealth of any city in the world in 2008. The city houses important financial institutions and the corporate headquarters of numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations. It is also home to some of India's premier scientific and nuclear institutes. The city is also home to Bollywood and Marathi cinema industries. Mumbai's business opportunities attract migrants from all over India."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Mumbai", "description": "Capital city of Maharashtra, India", "types": ["City", "Port",

While threatened in its native habitat, it is considered an invasive species in many other places.\n\nThe kiawe is a spreading bush or moderately sized tree, bearing spines, spikes of greenish-yellow flowers, and long pods filled with small brown seeds. It is a successful invasive species due to its ability to reproduce in two ways: production of large numbers of easily dispersed seeds, and suckering to create thick monotypic stands that shade out nearby competing plants. It survives well in dry environments due to a long taproot which can reach deep watertables. It is so efficient at extracting moisture from soil that it can kill nearby plants by depriving them of water, as well as by shading them out. It can be found in areas where other plants do not grow, such as sandy, dry, degraded slopes, salty soils, disturbed areas, and rocky cliffs.\n\nThe tree grows quickly and can live for over a millennium. It makes a good shade tree, if one does not mind the nasty thorns of the fallen branches. Its hard wood is a source of long-burning firewood and charcoal. Kiawe pods can be used as livestock fodder, ground into flour, turned into molasses or used to make beer. The light yellow flowers attract bees, which produce from them a sought-after white honey.\n\nFallen Kiawe branches usually contain sharp spines that can puncture both feet and tires.\n\nAt times the tree was used to replace forest and prevent erosion, and once it was established it generally dominates the habitat. It was introduced to Puerto Rico and Hawaii as well as New South Wales and Queensland in Australia and is now naturalized in those places. The first kiawe was planted in Hawaii in 1828; today it is a ubiquitous shade tree and invasive weed on the Hawaiian Islands, but provides firewood for heating and cooking.\n\nThe clearing of kiawe (\"huarango\") has been suggested as a major reason for the collapse of the Nazca culture in southern Peru at the beginning of the 6th century AD after an El Ni\u00f1o event led to flooding, erosion and desertification.\n\nEcologists consider the huarango important to the ecosystem of the desert area west of the Andes in southern Peru, because of its ability to bind moisture and counter erosion. Despite prohibitions by regional authorities, poor villagers continue to harvest the trees to make charcoal. Efforts are under way to reforest the area with huarangos.\n\nIn the southwest of Ecuador, \"Prosopis pallida\" and \"Prosopis juliflora\" both display substantial genetic variability due to the (intraspecific) cross-pollination of their self-incompatible flowers which are typical of the genus \"Prosopis\". As a result, trees of these species display a range of physical traits that lead to trees of one species resembling descriptions of the other, and the two species are often confused. To compound the difficulty in discerning the species of a given tree, these two species hybridise readily where their ranges overlap. In the semi-arid Zapotillo Canton of Ecuador, both thorn-bearing and thornless strains of \"Prosopis pallida\" exist with thorn-bearing trees being more common. It is the preferred tree of the local people for making charcoal and is sometimes also cut for firewood or fence posts."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Prosopis pallida", "description": "A species

However, the same site is believed to have been previously used for other places of worship since much earlier times. The Coflein website states that the older church was in mediaeval times dedicated to St Michael, although the dedication had been changed to St Bledrws by 1833.\n\nAccording to recently issued \"Notes on the History of Betws Bledrws Church\" (for distribution within the building), the spire and tower of the present church were built in 1830 \u2013 the date being on the weather-vane \u2013 and were possibly designed by the architect Charles Robert Cockerell. He built nearby Derry Ormond House (demolished in 1952) for a certain John Jones. Alternatively, the authors of \"The Buildings of Wales: Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion\" suggest that the conical square tower might have been by Rees Davies.\n\nThe church was for many years associated with the Inglis-Jones family, being the descendants of the said John Jones of Derry Ormond House, and they are commemorated in several internal memorials. John\u2019s grandchildren Herbert and Wilmot Inglis-Jones rebuilt the church in 1886, Wilmot, who succeeded his brother to the Derry Ormond estate in the following year, also served as organist for many years, besides being the father of the writer Elisabeth Inglis-Jones.\n\nThe font was re-erected on a modern pedestal, although the actual bowl is of particular interest, as it has a band of decoration of shallow incised lines around the upper part, which has been described as Romanesque. It is thought to be not much later than A.D. 1200. The church has some unusual and particularly special stained-glass windows, designed by Carl Almquist, a Swedish designer with the firm of Shrigley and Hunt of Lancaster. The organ was given by the Inglis-Jones family and was built by Cassons of London in 1900.\n\nThe surviving church registers date from 1813. A transcript of monumental inscriptions in the churchyard was published by the local family history society in 2018.\n\nBy the 21st century, Betws Bledrws formed part of a group ministry which also included the churches at Lampeter, Maestir, Silian and Llangybi.\n\nDerry Ormond Tower, a high column erected by John Jones, the squire of Derry Ormond, can be seen from the churchyard path."},

Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune. Cyclogenesis is the process of cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream.\n\nWeather fronts mark the boundary between two masses of air of different temperature, humidity, and densities, and are associated with the most prominent meteorological phenomena. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Such fronts form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east; warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. Warm fronts move poleward ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle near the center of the cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.\n\nTropical cyclogenesis describes the process of development of tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm core. Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. In the Atlantic and the northeastern Pacific oceans, a tropical cyclone is generally referred to as a hurricane (from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind, Huracan), in the Indian and south Pacific oceans it is called a cyclone, and in the northwestern Pacific it is called a typhoon.\nThe growth of instability in the vortices is not universal. For example, the size, intensity, moist-convection, surface evaporation, the value of potential temperature at each potential height can affect the nonlinear evolution of a vortex."}, "entities":

It used to be jointly owned by the advertising bureau association (\"Annonsbyr\u00e5f\u00f6reningen\") and the Swedish newspaper publishers' association (\"Tidningsutgivarna\", TU). In 1994 it was sold to Scribona, an office electronics redistributor, which was a recent spinn-off from the Esselte group. Scribona then acquired Sifo, merged TS into this, sold it to the British WPP Group, where it became SIFO Research International. The main offices for SIFO and TS remain in central Stockholm, at Vasagatan 11.\n\nTS is a member of the International Federation of Audit Bureaux of Circulations (IFABC).\n\nSwedish daily newspapers monitored by TS have a total circulation of 3.72 million copies (2008).

officially the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), established the federal Superfund program, administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The program is designed to investigate and clean up sites contaminated with hazardous substances. Sites managed under this program are referred to as \"Superfund\" sites. There are 40,000 federal Superfund sites across the country, and approximately 1,600 of those sites have been listed on the National Priorities List (NPL). Sites on the NPL are considered the most highly contaminated and undergo longer-term remedial investigation and remedial action (cleanups). \n\nThe EPA seeks to identify parties responsible for hazardous substances releases to the environment (polluters) and either compel them to clean up the sites, or it may undertake the cleanup on its own using the Superfund (a trust fund) and seek to recover those costs from the responsible parties through settlements or other legal means. \n\nApproximately 70% of Superfund cleanup activities historically have been paid for by the potentially responsible parties (PRPs), the latter reflecting the polluter pays principle. However, 30% of the time the responsible party either cannot be found or is unable to pay for the cleanup. In these circumstances, taxpayers pay for the cleanup. Through the 1980s, most of the funding came from a tax passed on to the consumers of petroleum and chemical products. However, in 1995, Congress chose not to renew this tax and the burden of the cost was shifted to tax payers. Since 2001, most of the cleanup of hazardous waste sites has been funded through taxpayers generally. Despite its name, the program has suffered from under-funding, and Superfund NPL cleanups have decreased to a mere 8 in 2014, out of over 1,200. \n\nThe EPA and state agencies use the Hazard Ranking System (HRS) to calculate a site score (ranging from 0 to 100) based on the actual or potential release of hazardous substances from a site. A score of 28.5 places a site on the National Priorities List, eligible for long-term, remedial action (i.e., cleanup) under the Superfund program. , there were 1,335 sites listed; an additional 424 had been delisted, and 51 new sites have been proposed.\n\nThe Superfund law also authorizes federal natural resource agencies, primarily the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), states and Native American tribes to recover natural resource damages caused by hazardous substances, though most states have and most often use their own versions of a state Superfund law. CERCLA created the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).\n\nThe primary goal of a Superfund cleanup is to reduce the risks to human health and human health in the environment through a combination of cleanup, engineered controls like caps and site restrictions such as groundwater use restrictions. A secondary goal is to return the site to productive use as a business, recreation or as a natural ecosystem. Identifying the intended reuse early in the cleanup often results in faster and less expensive cleanups. EPA's Superfund Redevelopment Initiative provides tools and support for site redevelopment."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of

One of the city's older suburbs, it is, as its name suggests, centred on the slopes which lie close to the city centre, particularly those closest to the city's original heart of The Exchange (for this reason, places are said to be \"on the City Rise\" rather than \"in City Rise\"). Extensive views across the central city can be gained from much of City Rise.\n\nThe name City Rise is generally applied to the area immediately to the west of Princes Street, especially to the approximately triangular area of one square kilometre bounded by Princes Street and the city's Town Belt, with Maitland Street and Stuart Street lying at the edge of the area. Some parts of the lower slopes at one time carried the name Fernhill, a term still occasionally encountered to refer to this area. Other notable streets on the City Rise include High Street, Rattray Street, Stafford Street, Arthur Street, Canongate, and Serpentine Avenue. The name City Rise is sometime used to cover a wider area extending further to the north along the inner edge of the Town Belt from Stuart Street and Moana Pool as far as the stately house Olveston and to the top of Pitt Street.\n\nCity Rise contains many of the city's earliest grand residences, notably along High Street and streets close to it. Many of these buildings were built on money which flowed into the infant city at the time of the Central Otago Gold Rush of 1861-2. Notable houses include Threave (designed by Robert Lawson), Moata, and Colquhouns, among many others. \n\nThe suburb is bounded by the central city to the east and northeast, by Kensington to the south, and Mornington to the west. The small suburb of Belleknowes lies immediately to the north, beyond which is Roslyn.\n\nThe suburb is mainly residential, though it also has strong links with the city's education. Otago Boys' High School lies close to Stuart Street in the north of City Rise, and the original site of Otago Polytechnic (or, as it was at the time, King Edward Technical College) is also on the city rise side of Stuart Street. Otago Girls' High School is located closer to the city centre at the edge of City Rise. Arthur Street School is also located in the suburb, close to Otago Boys' High School. Next to Arthur Street School's grounds is a monument on what was the site of Dunedin's first cemetery, Arthur Street Cemetery.\n\nThere is very little industry centred on City Rise, the most notable exception being Speight's Brewery, which is located at the foot of the rise close to the exchange. Immediately above this is St. Joseph's Cathedral, the city's Roman Catholic cathedral. Notable historical industrial connections with the suburb include Choie (Charles) Sew Hoy's importing company and the Kempthorne Prosser chemical manufacturing company, both of which had their main offices on Stafford Street.\n\nFrom the 1880s until the 1950s, City Rise was served by Dunedin's cable tramway, with lines running up from the Exchange to the hill suburbs of Mornington and Roslyn via Stuart Street and Rattray Street. The tramway was notable for being only the second of its type in the world (after the San Francisco cable car system).

Galopin for use by the Ligier team during the 1985 Formula One season. Like its predecessor, the JS23, the JS25 was powered by a turbocharged Renault V6 engine although the car ran on Pirelli instead of Michelin tyres after the French company pulled out of Grand Prix racing at the end of . Drivers of the car were initially their driver Andrea de Cesaris and veteran Jacques Laffite who returned to the team after two fruitless years at Williams, but after a series of crashes, de Cesaris was fired by team boss Guy Ligier and replaced by Philippe Streiff.\n\nUsing the JS25, the French team were able to score 23 points in 1985 and finished 6th in the Constructors Championship. Laffite was able to score two 3rd-place finishes and also a 2nd place at the season ending Australian Grand Prix where team mate Streiff also managed to finish 3rd, although his efforts to take 2nd from Laffite almost cause both cars to not finish the race. Streiff made contact with Laffite on the penultimate lap of the race and drove the last with his left front wheel almost off the car.\n\nEasily the most spectacular moment for the JS25 came at the Austrian Grand Prix when de Cesaris (aptly nicknamed \"de Crasheris\") destroyed his car in a high-speed rollover on lap 14. The team had not yet seen the accident on the television monitors when de Cesaris returned to the pits and he merely told them that the car had stalled and could not restart it, causing the team to be shocked when they finally saw the crash on replay. It was after this event that team owner Guy Ligier decided he could no longer afford the repair bills for de Cesaris's frequent crashes, stating \"I can no longer afford to employ this man\" (this was despite the Italian's personal sponsor Marlboro paying the bulk of his salary). He was replaced by Streiff after the next race in the Netherlands.\n\nIronically, Streiff was almost the cause of the team missing out on what would prove to be their best result of the season. In the final race of the season in Australia, Laffite and Streiff were headed for a safe 2nd and 3rd respectively behind race winner Keke Rosberg's Williams-Honda. On the penultimate lap, Streiff tried to overtake his team-mate for second place with almost disastrous results as the two cars collided. As a result, Streiff's front wheel axle was severely damaged. While Laffite carried on in second, Streiff managed to limp his JS25 home and retain third place despite only have three wheels firmly attached to the car, with the front left wheel bouncing up and down over the course of the last lap, but somehow remaining attached to the car. It would remain a career best finish for Streiff. Guy Ligier, not impressed that Streiff had almost taken out both team cars at the end of the race when they were both assured of a podium finish, would not offer the Frenchman a drive for 1986 as a result.\n\nThe JS25 was replaced for the season by the Ligier JS27."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Ligier JS25", "description": "A Formula One car designed by Michel Beaujon and Claude Galopin for

Neil Ieremia, the group's founder and choreographer, draws on M\u0101ori and Pacific Islander indigenous dance, as well as modern dance and hip hop. Ieremia graduated from the Auckland Performing Arts School and joined the Douglas Wright Dance Company, the leading New Zealand contemporary-dance company at the time. However, the founding members, such as Sam Fuataga and Sean MacDonald, initially had more experience with sports such as rugby, basketball and running than with dance. Performances remain infused with athleticism and may occasionally include a bit of whimsy that is less common in those of other troupes. In \"Human Language\", as the female dancers dance before them, the male dancers inflate toy balloons and look upward in mimicry of courting behavior of certain bird species.\n\nComing from a story-telling tradition called \"slap dancing\" that includes speaking, singing and slapping their bodies, Ieremia incorporates these elements in his choreography. Musical accompaniment includes Samoan indigenous music, Bach and hip hop.\n\nAs the foremost contemporary dance company in New Zealand, the company has toured extensively in that country, as well as the Netherlands, and North America. Their first appearance in the United States in August 2004 at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in New York City was well received. By the end of a week of performances, they were performing before \"vociferously enthusiastic, soldout houses.\" In 2005, Black Grace performed at the World Expo, Aichi and Tokyo. A documentary on the group, \"Black Grace: From Cannon's Creek to Jacob's Pillow\", premiered 21 June 2007 on PBS.\n\nIn March 2008, Black Grace gave two forty-minute performances before more than 10,000 people at WOMADelaide in southern Australia. An all-male company, four guest female dancers performed with six males in its eleven city 2008 tour of North America. As of 2008, the members are variously of M\u0101ori, Pacific Island, New Zealand and Australian descent. MacDonald and Ieremia are the only founding members that remain in the troupe.\n\nAccording to Ieremia, a New Zealander of Samoan ancestry, the term \"black\" in the company name refers to \"courage\" in the New Zealand M\u0101ori/Pacific Islander argot of the 1980s. \"Grace\" is a quality that he admires and to which he aspires."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Black Grace", "description": "An

He scored 63 goals in 56 games for the youth team and was subsequently called up to the first team. His goalscoring exploits increased hopes among the supporters that Semih could be the future of the Fenerbah\u00e7e attacking line. Indeed, he managed to become something of a regular fixture in the team during the 2007\u201308 campaign, in which he scored 17 goals and finished the season as S\u00fcper Lig's top scorer. His more prominent role in the team was rewarded after he was named as the vice-captain of the team in 2007 after the departure of the former captains \u00dcmit \u00d6zat and Tuncay.\n\nHe secured an away victory in the 2nd round of the Champions League qualifiers, guaranteeing a place for his team in the third knockout phase of the Champions League. His four goals against MTK Budapest on 6 August 2008 meant that Semih became only the second Turkish player after Fethi Heper to score four goals in a single European match. Also he is a member of the leader fan group Gen\u00e7 Fenerbah\u00e7eliler. In 2008, he signed his first extension contract keeping him at the club until May 2010. In 2011, he signed another contract extension which will keep him at the club until 2014.\n\n\u015eent\u00fcrk was called up the Turkey team following his successful performances in the 2007\u201308 season. He wears the number 9 shirt, which was previously worn by the Turkish football legend Hakan \u015e\u00fck\u00fcr. \u015eent\u00fcrk was selected as part of the squad for the finals of the European Championships in 2008. On 11 June he came on as a substitute in the 46th minute and in the 57th minute of Turkey's second Group A match against Switzerland, he scored the equaliser with a powerful header outjumping the Swiss defence and beating the goalkeeper, even though he got a hand on it.

of the Spheres Society", "text": "Inspired by the Neoplatonic academies of 16th and 17th-century Italy, which combined discourse with musical presentations, the Music of the Spheres Society was founded in 2001 by its artistic director and violinist, Stephanie Chase, and hornist Ann Ellsworth. Its first concert took place in New York City on November 1, 2001, the proceeds of which were donated to families of firefighters from two nearby stations who were killed at the World Trade Center disaster.\n\nThe mission of the Society is to promote classical music through innovative chamber music concerts and pre-concert lectures which illuminate music\u2019s historical, philosophical and scientific foundations, in order to give greater context for music to the average audience member.\nThe Music of the Spheres Society features a core group of artists - Stephanie Chase (violin), Hsin-Yun Huang (viola), and Jon Manasse (clarinet) - plus guest artists that include soloists, chamber musicians, and principal members of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. Its concerts feature works composed for one to nine performers, dating from the 16th to 21st centuries. Many of the Society's artists specialize in historically informed performance practices or contemporary music.\n\nOf a performance by the Society of Messiaen's \"Quartet for the End of Time\", a \"New York Times\" critic wrote: \"These musicians brought the music vividly to life in every particular. They should be playing it everywhere. They should go on the road with it tomorrow.\"\n\nConcert programs presented by the Society explore the contexts of music and include chamber music master-pieces, lesser-known works, and world or US premieres. Contemporary music performed by the Society has included world premieres and works by Edward Applebaum, John Harbison, Lou Harrison, and Jose Evangelista. Works by less-known composers - such as Juan Arriaga, Johan Kvandal, Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek, Jan Dussek, Zdenek Fibich, and Bohuslav Martinu - are programmed alongside composers such as Brahms, Schubert, Mozart, Ravel, Beethoven, and Prokofiev.\n\nSince 2001 the Society has presented a series of chamber music concerts in New York City - at venues that include Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, Merkin Concert Hall, the Society for Ethical Culture - and has been presented by concert organizations that include The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Dallas Chamber Music and Troy (NY) Friends of Music. The Society presents concerts on both original and modern style instruments.\n\nLectures presented by the Society focus primarily on a philosophical, scientific, or historic aspect of music and reveal some of the historic contexts of composed music. Guest lecturers have included music historians, an organologist, a Freudian analyst, music therapists, and ethnomusicologists.\n\n\u201cMusic of the Spheres\u201d is a term applied to an idea put forth by the Greek scholar Pythagoras (6th century BCE) and his followers, among them Plato and Kepler, that the proportional ratios used to describe musical intervals also refer to those of the physical universe, including the orbiting motion of planets. Pythagoras recognized the innate connection between musical sound, or its \u201cpitch,\u201d and the physical characteristics of an object producing that sound. He is credited with discovering the physical laws of musical sound through his observations that the ratio of mass - as in a vibrating string length sounding an interval - of a fifth is 2:3, that of an octave is 1:2, and that of the fourth is 3:4. Thus, he proved that there is a correlation between the vibrations of sound and the physical world, such as that of numbers and proportion. (See Music and mathematics.)\n\nIncorporated in February 2002, the Music of the Spheres Society is a non-profit, 501 c(3) organization."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Music of the Spheres

the transformation of a young man from a moderately wealthy family in the British colony of Virginia motivated largely by self-interest into the first president of the United States and the father of his country. Washington was ambitious for the status and influence with which he had been surrounded in a youth spent around his half-brother Lawrence and the influential Fairfax family Lawrence married into. After working as a surveyor, a position he gained with the patronage of the Fairfaxes, Washington sought to emulate his brother's military career with a commission in the Virginia militia, despite his lack of military experience. With the patronage of more influential people, he was appointed major in 1752. The following year, he was appointed special envoy charged with delivering to the French a demand to vacate territory claimed by the British. His successful completion of this task gained him his first measure of renown. Washington was promoted in 1754 and made second-in-command of the Virginia Regiment. He enhanced his reputation with his first military victory in the Battle of Jumonville Glen, a skirmish that ignited the French and Indian War. He was promoted again in 1755 and given command of the regiment, serving until his resignation in 1758. During his military service, Washington grew disillusioned with the British because of his treatment as a second-class citizen and the defensive strategy they adopted during the war. He gained no further opportunity for military honor and failed to achieve his ambition of a royal commission in the British Army. \n\nHis election to the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1758 and his marriage to Martha Dandridge Custis the next year gave Washington wealth, real estate and social advancement to the upper echelons of Virginia society. He focused more on his business interests at his Mount Vernon plantation than his political career as a burgess and was an aggressive speculator in real estate. Washington became increasingly disillusioned by colonial dependence on Great Britain, the obstacles British policy placed in the way of his business interests, and the overbearing authority exercised by the British in colonial affairs. By 1769, he was denouncing British policy as a threat to liberty and was one of the first to speak of a resort to arms. He became increasingly involved in politics and was elected as one of the Virginia delegates to the First and Second Continental Congresses. His election to command the Continental Army in 1775 at the start of the American Revolutionary War completed Washington's transformation from someone intent on self-advancement to someone who advanced the cause of an independent republic. Victory cemented Washington's reputation, and his relinquishing of the command of the army in 1783 won him widespread acclaim as a modern-day Cincinnatus. After the war, Washington played a key role in establishing a strong national government and served two terms as the first president of the United States.\n\nWashington was eulogized after his death in 1799 as a patriot devoid of ambition. Modern historians conclude that ambition was a driving force in his career and frequently characterize it as a desire for fame and honor. Once Washington gained a reputation he became very protective of it. His decisions to accept public office were often informed by the effect they would have on his reputation. Cultivating an image of a disinterested patriot, he ceased soliciting important appointments as he had done in his early career. Instead, he hesitated to accept public office, frequently protesting his inadequacy and insisting that he was accepting only at the entreaty of his friends or the call of his country. Historians are divided on Washington's true motivations; some maintain that public office was a burden he was genuinely reluctant to take on, others that reluctance was a political technique he employed to increase his authority and influence."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "George Washington", "description": "The first president of the United States and a key figure in the American Revolution.", "types": ["Individual", "Politician", "Military Leader"]}, {"label": "Virginia", "description": "A British colony in North America that later became a state in the United States.", "types": ["Geographic Location"]}, {"label": "Lawrence Washington", "description": "George Washington's half-brother who had a significant influence on his early life.", "types": ["Individual"]}, {"label": "Fairfax family", "description": "An influential family in Virginia that George Washington was associated with in his youth.", "types": ["Family", "Social Group"]}, {"label": "Surveyor", "description": "A person who measures and maps out the boundaries and features of a piece of land.", "types": ["Profession"]}, {"label": "Virginia militia", "description": "A military force made up of citizens of Virginia.", "types": ["Military Unit"]}, {"label": "French and Indian War", "description": "A conflict between Great Britain and France and their respective Native American allies in North America.", "types": ["Historical Event", "War"]}, {"label": "Battle of Jumonville Glen", "description": "A skirmish that took place during the French and Indian War and was George Washington's first military victory.", "types": ["Historical Event", "War"]}, {"label": "Mount Vernon", "description": "George Washington's plantation home in Virginia.", "types": ["Building", "Residence"]}, {"label": "Continental Congress", "description": "A series of meetings held by American colonial delegates to coordinate resistance to British rule and eventually declare independence.", "types": ["Political Organization"]}, {"label": "Continental Army", "description": "The army formed by the colonies during the American Revolution, with George Washington as its commander-in-chief.", "types": ["Military Unit"]}, {"label": "American Revolutionary War", "description": "A war fought by the colonies against Great Britain for independence.", "types": ["Historical Event", "War"]}, {"label": "Cincinnatus", "description": "A Roman statesman and military leader who served as a model of civic virtue and selflessness.

Cambern was born in Los Angeles, California, and obtained a B.A. in music from UCLA. In 2007, Cambern was senior filmmaker-in-residence at the American Film Institute Conservatory.\n\nCambern began his career as a Music Editor for \"The Andy Griffith Show\", before moving into the field of film editing. \n\nCambern has edited such films as \"Easy Rider\" (1969) and \"Romancing the Stone\" (1984), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Film Editing along with fellow editor Frank Morriss. Cambern was awarded the American Cinema Editors Career Achievement Award in 2004.\n\nOfficially credited with editing \"The Last Picture Show\" (1971), Cambern's involvement was called into question in the 1999 documentary, \"The Last Picture Show: A Look Back\". In the documentary, Peter Bogdanovich said that after shooting the film, he went back to Los Angeles to edit it on a Moviola. When finished editing the entire picture, he refused to credit himself as editor, reasoning that credits beyond that of director and co-writer would look 'ridiculous'. After being informed that the Motion Picture Editors Guild \"required\" crediting an editor, he suggested Donn Cambern who had been editing another film in the next office over and had helped Bogdanovich with some purchasing paperwork. In the documentary, Cybill Shepherd said that when she went to stay with Bogdanovich during that time, it was disappointing because he was too busy editing the film.\n\nCambern disputes this, stating that Bogdanovich did do an edit of the film, which he screened for a selection of guests, including Jack Nicholson, Bob Rafelson and himself. The consensus was the film was going to be great, but needed further editing to achieve its full potential. Bogdanovich invited Cambern to edit the film further and Cambern made significant contributions to the film's final form.\n\nOne of Cambern's favorite stories and something for which he is often remembered is the editing of the final sequence of the Robert Wise film \"The Hindenburg\", in which Cambern manages to keep the Hindenburg blowing up for almost 10 minutes when the actual event lasted little more than 37 seconds.\n\nCambern has been elected as a member of the American Cinema Editors. Cambern has served twice (1990\u201394, 1997\u201399) as Vice-President of the Board of Governors for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. From 1991-2002, he was President of the Motion Picture Editors Guild. \n\nCambern was the inaugural recipient of the Guild's Fellowship and Service Award in 2007."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label":

Jacobs completed her undergraduate degree at McPherson College. After a year spent teaching high school she was awarded one of the first two fellowships to study graduate-level mathematics at the University of Kansas, where she earned her master's degree in 1916. She earned her Ph.D in mathematics from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign in 1919 under the supervision of Arthur Byron Coble. She became an associate professor at Rockford College and then, in 1920, an instructor at the University of Texas at Austin, where she also edited the \"Texas Mathematics Teachers' Bulletin\". Her tenure at the university, along with that of colleague Goldie Printis Horton, is recognized by an annual lecture series.\n\nWhile at the University of Texas, she met geneticist Hermann Joseph Muller, when he asked her for help modeling the mathematics of mutation in flies. The couple married in 1923. Their son David, who would become a mathematician and computer scientist, was born the following year. Jessie's university appointment was terminated in 1924 against her wishes: her departmental colleagues felt that academia and motherhood were incompatible. Her own teaching career over, Jessie collaborated with her husband in the \"Drosophila\" laboratory and co-authored an article with him. Muller would later win a Nobel prize for the research he performed with Jessie's assistance during this period.\n\nThe marriage had grown strained, but in 1933 Jessie joined Hermann Muller in Berlin and then Leningrad for a portion of his Guggenheim fellowship. She divorced her husband in 1935 (first in the Soviet Union, then in Texas) and within a few months remarried Carlos Alberto Offermann. He had worked in Hermann Muller's Leningrad laboratory from 1933-1934. After marrying Jessie in Texas Carlos returned to his position, now relocated to Moscow, though his wife and stepson were unable to join him. So long as his father remained in the Soviet Union, a Texas judge refused to permit David Muller to leave the state. Jessie made a living in Austin by tutoring university students in mathematics, subletting a room, and supervising a Works Progress Administration group writing a history of Travis County.\n\nIn 1938, Carlos Offermann returned to Austin, and the family soon moved to Chicago. Assisted by his wife, Carlos pursued experimental work necessary for his Ph.D. Jessie was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and in 1940 the family moved to California, where they hoped she could recuperate. In 1942, her health had deteriorated and she was forced to enter a sanitarium, and was institutionalized at the time of her death."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Jessie Marie Jacobs Muller Offermann", "description": "American mathematician who also made contributions to the field of genetics", "types": ["Mathematician", "Geneticist"]}, {"label": "McPherson College", "description": "Undergraduate institution attended by Jessie M.

The phrase is used to invoke a stereotype of shallow, leisured, upper-class toffs (tennis is often seen as a posh game for the rich, with courts popular at country clubs and private estates). It's a stereotypical entrance or exit line given to a young man of this class in a superficial drawing-room comedy.\n\nA close paraphase of the saying, was used in George Bernard Shaw's 1914 drawing-room comedy \"Misalliance\", in which Johnny Tarleton asks \"Anybody on for a game of tennis?\" (An 1891 story in the satirical magazine \"Punch\" put a generally similar notion in the mouth of a similar type of character: \"I\u2019m going to see if there\u2019s anyone on the tennis-court, and get a game if I can. !\".)\n\n\"Anyone for tennis?\" is particularly associated with the early career of Hollywood star Humphrey Bogart. At the start of his career, in the 1920s and early 1930s, Bogart appeared in many Broadway plays in what Jeffrey Meyers characterized as \"charming and fatuous roles \u2013 in [one of] which he is supposed to have said 'Tennis, anyone?'\".\nIf Bogart ever did speak the line, it would have presumably been in the 1925 play \"Hell's Bells\", set at the Tanglewood Lodge in New Dauville, Connecticut. Bogart claimed that his line in the play was \"It's forty-love outside. Anyone care to watch?\", and that indeed is what is printed in the script. However, according to Darwin Porter, director John Hayden crossed out that line and replaced it with \"Tennis anyone?\" before opening night. And several observers have asserted that he did say it, reportedly including Louella Parsons and Richard Watts Jr.. Erskine Johnson, in a 1948 interview, reports Bogart as saying \"I used to play juveniles on Broadway and came bouncing into drawing rooms with a tennis racket under my arm and the line: 'Tennis anybody?' It was a stage trick to get some of the characters off the set so the plot could continue.\" But Bogart's usual stance was denial of using that precise phrase (\"The lines I had were corny enough, but I swear to you, never once did I have to say 'Tennis, anyone?'\"), although averring that it did characterize generally some of his early roles.\n\nThe phrase continued to drift through popular culture in the 20th century and, to a diminished extent, into the 21st. It appears in the lyric of the \"Beautiful Girl Montage\" in the classic 1952 musical movie \"Singin' in the Rain,\" and in the lyric and title of the song \"Anyone for Tennis\" by the British rock band Cream, which was the theme song of the film \"The Savage Seven\". The stage play \"Anyone for Denis?\" riffs on the name, as does the television series \"Anyone for Tennyson?\"; Daffy Duck used the phrase in the cartoons \"Rabbit Fire, Drip-Along Daffy\" and \"The Ducksters\", and so forth.

using a series of still images, usually combined with text. It typically the form of a sequence of panels of images. Textual devices such as speech balloons, captions, and onomatopoeia can indicate dialogue, narration, sound effects, or other information. The size and arrangement of panels contribute to narrative pacing. Cartooning and other forms of illustration are the most common image-making means in comics; \"fumetti\" is a form which uses photographic images. Common forms include gag-a-day comic strips, editorial and gag cartoons, and comic books. Since the late 20th century, bound volumes such as graphic novels, comic albums, and \"\" have become increasingly common, while online webcomics have proliferated in the 21st century.\n\nThe history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures, but by the mid-20th century comics flourished, particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, but the medium truly became popular in the 1930s following the success of strips and books such as \"The Adventures of Tintin\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\"\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War\u00a0II era (1945\u2013) with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka (\"Astro Boy\", et al.). had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and academics.\n\nThe term \"comics\" is used as a singular noun when it refers to the medium itself (e.g. \"\"Comics is\" a visual art form.\"), but becomes plural when referring to works collectively (e.g. \"\"Comics are\" popular reading material.\"). Though the term derives from the humorous (\"\") work that predominated in early American newspaper comic strips, it has become standard for non-humorous works too. The alternate spelling \"comix\" \u2013 coined by the underground comix movement \u2013 is sometimes used to address these ambiguities. In English, it is common to refer to the comics of different cultures by the terms used in their original languages, such as \"\" for Japanese comics, or \" (B.D.)\" for French-language comics.\n\nThere is no consensus among theorists and historians on a definition of \"comics\"; some emphasize the combination of \"images and text\", some \"sequentiality\" or other image relations, and others historical aspects, such as \"mass reproduction\" or the use of \"recurring characters\". Increasing cross-pollination of concepts from different comics cultures and eras has only made definition more difficult."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Comics", "description": "A medium that

He works within a research centre called LISE (Laboratoire interdisciplinaire en sociologie \u00e9conomique or \"interdisciplinary laboratorium on economic sociology\").\n\nHe graduated from \u00c9cole polytechnique of France and from Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Paris.\n\nd'Iribarne is one of the most notable critics of the limitations of the works of Geert Hofstede, expressing concern that \"a theory of culture that considers culture to be \u2018shared meaning\u2019 does not allow for representation of the forms of unity and continuity.\" Part of d'Iribarne's objections have been with the weaknesses of Hofstede's terminology in general and category names specifically (e.g., power distance as a culture as whole versus a culture's acceptance of hierarchy only within organizational settings). More pointedly, d'Iribarne questions the generalized conclusions that Hofstede draws from the data, imposing Hofstede's own value system on what the data show. For instance, d'Iribarne questioned Hofstede's conclusions from the uncertainty avoidance statistics, arguing that Hofstede superimposes his own view that data. For d'Iribarne, Hostede simply presumes that showing high stress at work correlates with weak uncertainty avoidance, while d'Iribarne asserts that the presence of high stress could just as readily indicate high stress results from high uncertainty avoidance, since no external control exists in low uncertainty avoidance cultures. Finally, d'Iribarne questions Hofstede's implicit assumption of uniformity in complex organizations, let alone entire national cultures. Such assumptions of uniformity are useful, d'Iribarne writes only \"if one thinks of a culture specific to a close-knit community.\" Instead, though, d'Iribarne notes that in most situations, \"society is split into more or less antagonistic groups\" and in any case, \"meaning is not only received but produced\"; in short, Hofstede does not allow for the fact that people do not remain static in how they interact with one another. Philippe d'Iribarne fills out the bare bones of Hofstede's simplified structure, a point with which Hofstede himself acknowledged when he wrote that,\"The two approaches are complementary -- mine is more quantitative, d'iribarne's more qualitative. I provided a skeleton for the countries he studied, and he provided the flesh. The skeleton I proposed is a worldwide structure in cultural differences among cultures.\" \n\nIribarne's interest is on the influence of national cultures on the way organisations function. He and his team within the LISE have so far surveyed organisations in 40-odd countries in Europe, Africa, America and Asia. Jorion has also published in the Revue de Mauss, a French anti-utilitarian journal.

The Village Wait", "text": "Hark! The Village Wait is the debut album by the British folk rock band Steeleye Span, first released in 1970. It is the only album to feature the original lineup of the band as they broke up and reformed with an altered membership immediately after its release, without ever having performed live. Therefore, it is one of only two Steeleye Span studio albums to feature two female vocalists (Maddy Prior and Gay Woods), the other being \"Time\" (1996). A similar sound was apparent years later when Prior teamed up with June Tabor to form Silly Sisters. Overall, the album's sound is essentially folk music with rock drumming and bass guitar added to some of the songs. The banjo features prominently on several tracks, including \"Blackleg Miner\", \"Lowlands of Holland\" and \"One Night as I Lay on My Bed\".\n\nThe album's title refers not to the act of waiting, but to a \"wait\", a small body of wind instrumentalists employed by a town at public charge from Tudor times until the early 19th century. A village, however, would likely be too small to employ such a troupe, so the wait referred to here was most probably the later Christmas Waits, as mentioned in the novels of Thomas Hardy.\n\nOver the years, the band has returned to the material on this album several times. On their second album, \"Please to See the King\", they offered a new version of \"The Blacksmith\". A new live version of \"Blackleg Miner\" appeared on \"Back in Line\", and they offered a third variation on \"Present--The Very Best of Steeleye Span\". On \"Time\" they reprised \"Twa Corbies\". \"Copshawholme Fair\" had two years earlier been recorded by Prior and Tim Hart on their album \"Folk Songs of Olde England Vol. 2\". Copshaw Holm, otherwise known as Newcastleton, has been the site of a folk festival since 1970. Maddy Prior has lived nearby, just over the border in Cumbria, at 'Stones Barn' for several years.\n\nAmong the other songs on the album are the a cappella \"A Calling-On Song\" (the first of many a cappella pieces the band recorded), \"The Hills of Greenmore\" and \"Dark-Eyed Sailor\". The version of \"Lowlands of Holland\" here uses variant lyrics from the most common version of the song.\n\nThe album was originally issued in the UK on RCA, with the cover shown (above right). It was not issued in the US at that time. The cover for the reissue was changed to a sepia-toned image of 'The Leather Bottle', a pub in Cobham; it was issued on UK Chrysalis (and made its debut in the US on US Chrysalis) in 1975."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Hark!

Monetta, (born 1942) served as the Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering (Research and Advanced Technology) from 1991 to 1993, acting as the de facto Chief Technology Officer for the United States Department of Defense. He had previously held the position of Director, Office of New Production Reactors, at the United States Department of Energy from 1989\u20131991, in addition to serving as the Technical Director and the Senior Executive at the Naval Ordnance Station, Indian Head, Maryland from 1986\u20131989.\nDr. Monetta serves as the science and technology member of the Board of Hudson Technologies, Inc, The Center for Security Policy, The PAM Institute and the Nevada Test Site Historical Foundation.\n\nThroughout his career, he has been an early proponent advocating for development of alternative mobility fuels.\nDr. Monetta worked extensively in operations pioneering new energy technology. He was responsible for designing and building the new U.S. Tritium Production Reactors, which would have been the only and largest nuclear reactors to be built in the United States in the past three decades and the single largest construction project in the federal government at the time.\nAn article in the Journal of Business and Behavioral Sciences credits Dr. Monetta with instituting a management style that \u201chelped create a positive, competitive environment for sponsoring and encouraging innovation\u201d to \u201cjump-start tritium production while securing the future of American reactor design.\u201d\n\nDr. Monetta's experience in the nuclear field was also applied to the Natural Gas industry, as his management concepts were instituted at the [Gas Research Institute] (GRI). A 1993 article shows that using this methodology, the GRI's Research and Development arm saw a \u201csuccess rate of at least twice the [industry] norms\u201d which allowed \u201cincreased gas availability at lower prices.\u201d The R&D undertaken by GRI \u201cled the way to a family of high-efficiency furnaces\u201d as well as innovations in \u201cdevelopment of technology to allow recovery of unconventional gas.\u201d\n\nDr. Monetta's demonstrated commitment to innovation and development of alternative fuels has continued into the realm of hydrogen technology. In 2004, he delivered a presentation at the SMART TechTrends Conference where he summarized the US approach to Hydrogen technology and urged swift action:\n\n\u201cThe problem for the U.S. is that waiting 25 years is not an option because the United States consumes more energy than any other country in the world\u2026\u201cHydrogen represents an instant opportunity for capital expansion, growth, wealth accumulation and individual energy independence, security and prosperity.\u201d\n\nHe recommended several policy changes to help grow the Hydrogen industry, suggesting that legislators:\n\n\u201cProvide short term items in the Department of Energy budget against a mid and long term R&D program plan. R&D is a critical element in the progression to the next level economy. The promise of the Hydrogen future rests in the ability of creative inventors to finagle meager dollars for advanced concepts, materials, storage and fuel.\u201d\n\nHe championed an initiative to \u201cchange out the entire U.S. government fleet\u201d from fossil fuel to hydrogen vehicles.\nHe encouraged promoting \u201cthe \u201cpersonal perk\u201d exemption from HOV restrictions for Hydrogen fuel vehicles\u201d, which the Commonwealth of Virginia did in 2006, and again by extending the law in 2011.\nLastly, Dr. Monetta implored legislators to establish \u201ca 50% tax credit for anything Hydrogen (production, storage, transportation, consumption), allowing Hydrogen to be special and competitive with gasoline.\u201d\n\nDr. Monetta received a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Manhattan College, a M.S. in Engineering Administration (Operations research) from the George Washington University, and a Doctorate in Public Administration (R&D Management) from the University of Southern California."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Dominic J.

It covers an area of 4,958.60 square kilometers, lying in the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, and Veracruz.\n\nThe climate is temperate and subtropical, semi-arid to subhumid, with summer rains. Average annual temperature 12-16\u00a0\u00b0C, and annual total precipitation is 400\u2013800\u00a0mm. The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests ecoregion covers the mountains surrounding the basin to the west, north, and east. The mountains to the north and west, including the Cofre de Perote volcano, leave the valley in a rain shadow, and the xeric shrublands of the Tehuac\u00e1n Valley matorral ecoregion occupies the center of the basin, and extend south into the Tehuac\u00e1n and Cuicatl\u00e1n valleys. Vegetation includes pine-oak forests and pine-fir forests at higher elevations, with dry scrub pine forests, oak forests, juniper scrub, yucca scrub, halophytic vegetation, and grassland. It includes the Llanos de San Juan and Llanos de San Andres.\n\nThe basin contains several shallow, mostly alkaline lakes. Two ephemeral playa lakes, Totolcinco (El Carmen or Totolcingo) and Tepeyahualco (El Salado), lie in the lowest part of the basin (2300 meters elevation), and remain dry for most of the year. The basin includes six maar lakes, locally called \"axalpazcos\", lying in shallow volcanic craters and sustained by underground water. A northern group of lakes \u2013 Alchichica, Quechulac, Atexcac, and La Preciosa \u2013 lie southeast of Lake Tepeyahualco, and the southern lakes, Aljojuca and San Miguel Tecuitlapa, lie southeast of Lake Totolcinco. The basin also has five dry maars, called \"xalapazcos\".\n\nChief towns in the basin include El Carmen Tequexquitla, Tlaxcala; Perote, Veracruz; and Oriental, Puebla.\n\nGroundwater levels in the basin have been dropping in recent years because of over-exploitation for irrigation and destruction of natural recharging areas.

Wilfrid had appealed to the papacy around 700, and Pope Sergius I had sent the matter back to Britain to be decided locally. This resulted in Aldfrith convening the council in either 702 or 703 according to different sources. The date of the council has been calculated from two pieces of information: that it took place 22 years after the decision to expel Wilfrid from York, around 679\u2013680, and that Wilfrid had held episcopal office for almost 40 years when Austerfield was convened. This would make the date of the council sometime before 704.\n\nThe council was called at a place described as \"in campo qui Eostrefeld dicitur\" and \"in campo qui dicitur Oustraefelda\", which has led to the site of the council being identified with Austerfield near Bawtry in South Yorkshire (formerly in the West Riding of Yorkshire). Another possible location is Nosterfield near Ripon in the North Riding of Yorkshire. The main determining factor in favouring Austerfield over Nosterfield is that Nosterfield is not attested as a location before the 13th century.\n\nThe council was presided over by Berhtwald, the Archbishop of Canterbury. It was attended by bishops from the entirety of the Anglo-Saxon church, both from Northumbria and from the southern part of Britain. Besides the bishops, abbots from monasteries in Britain are recorded as attending at Austerfield, and Wilfrid's biographer records that Wilfrid was accompanied by a number of priests and deacons. Laymen were also present, including King Aldfrith, as well as some of Aldfrith's thegns.\n\nOne account of the council survives, that of Wilfrid's biographer, Stephen of Ripon in the \"Vita Sancti Wilfrithi\". Aldfrith and Berhtwald opposed Wilfrid's desire to return to York, but Wilfrid was supported by King \u00c6thelred of Mercia, who had given Wilfrid shelter while he was in exile. Most of the bishops attending as well as some abbots appear to have opposed Wilfrid. According to Stephen, Wilfrid's opponents wanted to seize all Wilfrid's properties and offices, but Berhtwald offered a compromise that would have allowed Wilfrid to retain some monasteries but would have prevented him from performing the office of bishop. In response, Wilfrid gave a long speech that described all his career as a churchman. The main difficulty lay in Wilfrid's refusal to obey Berhtwald, who had archiepiscopal authority over him. The decision of the council was that Wilfrid should remain exiled from York and return to the monastery of Ripon and not leave and no longer be a bishop. Wilfrid disagreed with this decision and appealed to the papacy again.\n\nWilfrid was eventually reconciled to the archbishop, bishops and laymen at the Council of Nidd in 705."}, "entities": {"gpt":

It was the first time that Australia had won a World Championship in a winter sport.\n\nAustralia's short track relay team went into the 1992 Olympics as world champions, but the team crashed in the semi-finals. The Australians were in third place when Richard Nizielski lost his footing; they finished fourth and failed to reach the final. Hansen and his teammates finished seventh overall.\n\nIn 1994, Hansen was part of the short track relay team won Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. They scraped into the four-team final after edging out Japan and New Zealand to finish second in their semi-final. They adopted a plan of staying on their feet as first priority, and remaining undisqualified and beating at least one of the other three finalists. During the race, the Canadians fell and lost significant time, meaning that Australia would win their first medal if they raced conservatively and avoided a crash. Late in the race, Nizielski was fighting with his American counterpart for track position for the silver medal, but took the safe option and yielded, mindful of the lost opportunity following the crash in Albertville. Thus Hansen, Nizielski, Andrew Murtha and Steven Bradbury became Australia's first Winter Olympics medallists.\n\nIn the 1,000\u00a0m event he came second in his heat and then came third in his quarterfinal and was eliminated; he finished eleventh. In the 500-metre contest he came third in his heat and was eliminated and finished 23rd.\n\nBradbury, Nizielski and Hansen, three of the quartet that won Australia's maiden medal in 1994 returned with new teammate Richard Goerlitz, and there were hopes that they could repeat their Lillehammer performance. However, in their qualifying race, they placed third in a time of 7\u00a0m 11.691\u00a0s and missed the final by one place, even though they had been two seconds faster than their medal-winning performance in 1994. They completed the course four seconds slower in the B final and came last in the race, and thus last out of eight teams overall. Hansen was not selected in any of the individual events. At this Olympics, Hansen skated under Murtha, who acted as the manager of the team.\n\nIn his early years, Murtha and Hansen learned to skate at the Blacktown Ice Racing Club, in the outer western working-class suburb of Blacktown. Hansen's mother Helen said \"These boys are pure western suburbs \u2013 kids with a one-track mind\", attributing their success to their determination. During his career, Hansen trained at Canterbury Olympic Rink, in the western Sydney suburb of Canterbury, New South Wales. His training colleagues included Murtha and Winter Olympic figure skaters Steven and Danielle Carr.\n\nHansen later introduced Jeremy Rolleston to winter sports. Rolleston was a rugby sevens player and had trouble believing Hansen at first, but eventually agreed to submit himself to physical aptitude tests. Rolleston went on to compete at the 2006 Winter Olympics in the two-man bobsled."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Kieran Hansen", "description": "Australian short track speed skater who competed in

Iowa formed in 2006, consisting of the Emcee Asphate Woodhavet, Turntablist Dj TouchNice, and Hip hop producer Aeon Grey.\n\nTheir debut eponymous album was released May 6, 2008 by Central Standard Records, an Iowa-bred underground label co-founded by Aeon Grey. The album set the tone for subsequent works, establishing an approach which consistently includes a significant portion of the work presented without vocals, providing an overall presentation of an instrumental and poetically commentated piece.\n\nThe vocal pieces are known for dynamic use of voice and often esoteric wordplay unique to the track paired with it, which at times, has been known to lead non-familiar listeners to assume that multiple vocalists play a part in the work. To date, no featuring of any other vocal artist has appeared on a Maxilla Blue record, as all production and turntablism has also been exclusively provided by Aeon Grey and Dj TouchNice. Members of the group have noted no intention of altering this trend, publicly stating that it is unnecessary to feature external components to create their sound. Each member has, however, participated in numerous side-works with other artists to create pieces under various titles. As the approach and presentation has remained intact, each subsequent release has carried the self-titled attribute, distinguished only by the numbered volume. It is said that were it not for the necessity of distinguishing the releases from each other for distributive purposes, the trio would have released each record simply as \"Maxilla Blue,\" leaving the familiar listener and general consumers to differentiate the body of work.\n\nThrough tour-work, the group has appeared live in the Midwest, Mountain, West coast and Southwestern U.S regions, Germany and France.\n\nVol. 2 was released June 15, 2010, also on Central Standard Records, marking the first edition of the ongoing series to be presented to the public as a vinyl LP as well as compact disc and digital form.\n\nVol. 3's retail release date of February 28, 2012 marked the 5th collaborative work from the trio and the 3rd of the self-titled series. The third installment was completed as a split release between Central Standard Records and Galapagos4. Joining the likes of Qwel & Maker, Typical Cats, Qwazaar & Batsauce and various other underground rap and hip hop production veterans, Maxilla's most recent work is again presented in the 3 aforementioned formats."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Maxilla Blue", "description": "An American hip hop trio consisting of Asphate Woodhavet, Dj TouchNice, and Aeon Grey.", "types": ["Musical
