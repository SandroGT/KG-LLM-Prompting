[{"doc": {"id": 0, "uri": "https://www.sardegnaturismo.it/en/places/sud/cagliari", "title": "Cagliari", "text": "Cagliari; The capital of Sardinia is steeped in Mediterranean atmosphere and offers everything you could want from a vacation: history and art, seashores and parks, comfort and fine cuisine. Picturesque historical districts with sea views, elegant shopping streets and panoramic terraces, including the bastione di Santa Croce, a great place for a romantic evening after a fiery sunset. Cagliari is Sardinia's main and most populous city, at the centre of an urban area that counts 430,000 inhabitants (150,000 of them in the capital city alone) as well as the island's gateway port and main Mediterranean cruise liner hub. The city's history goes back thousands of years, from pre-historic times to the reign of the Savoy. The Castello quarter sits perched on its highest hill and boasts ancient bastions that today are the heart and soul of nightlife, and picturesque streets lined by grand old homes: Palazzo Regio and Palazzo di Citta, as well as the Cathedral of Santa Maria. The medieval towers - dell'Elefante and San Pancrazio - that stand guard at the entrance to the castle are well worth notice. Villanova connects to the Castle quarter via the stairway of the bastione di Saint Remy. A passionate air of religious devotion takes over the quarter every year at Easter, during Holy Week, while during the rest of the year the elegant boutiques and churches welcome you with somewhat less ado: the cloister of San Domenico, the Church of San Saturnio, and the Basilica di Nostra Signora di Bonaria, the Christian temple of Sardinia. Below Castello you'll find the Marina quarter, which will impress you with lovely buildings and the porticos of Via Roma, including the Palazzo Civico. Settled as a village of fishermen and merchants, it is the symbol of the town's multi-ethnicity. Here you will find the Church of Sant'Eulalia, home to precious remains from the Roman era. The Stampace quarter is the venue of the colourful yearly festival of Sant'Efisio in May, an event the entire island enjoys. Its narrow streets are home to the baroque Church of Sant'Anna. Don't forget to visit the nearby Anfiteatro, one of Sardinia's most important Roman ruins, and the Botanical gardens, a green oasis in the city's centre. Just outside of town is the Castle of San Michele and Tuvixeddu, the Mediterranean's largest Phoenician-Punic necropolis (VI-III century BCE). When you are ready to surround yourself with nature, you can head towards a thousand different natural attractions: the Cagliari lagoon, the Molentargius-Saline park, which you can visit on a mountain bike, to see the pink flamingos take flight, and, of course, the sea. Take a dip at Poetto, the city's 8 km long soft sandy beach along which there is a walking trail and cycling path. Even at night, when it reveals its more glamorous side, it is a delight. You can take an excursion to Calamosca and Sella del Diavolo from Poetto. And, finally, there is the local cuisine to be enjoyed, spaghetti with bottarga (cured mullet or tuna roe) and artichokes, burrida made with catshark and walnuts, and fregula con cocciula, balls of semola with clams."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Cagliari", "description": "The capital city of Sardinia, offering history, art, seashores, parks, and fine cuisine.", "types": ["City", "Tourist

"Sant'Efisio martire; . In the midst of narrow streets in the heart of Stampace, a medieval district of Cagliari, stands the church from where one of the oldest religious celebrations in Italy and the most engaging of the island set out each 1st May, being the Festa di Sant'Efisio. The original building dates back to the 13th-century, constructed over a grotto that opens into the limestone to a depth of nine metres, considered by the local faithful as being the prison in which Efisio was locked up before being martyred and beheaded on Nora beach (303 AD). The church was expanded and modified in 1538, when the oratory was built alongside, perhaps designed by the Piedmont architect De Vincenti, who was working in Cagliari at the time on the restoration of the former Collegio Gesuita di Santa Croce. At the end of the 18th century, new operations conferred the present appearance of the church, typical of the 18th century Piedmontese Baroque style. The reconstruction was completed in 1782.\nThe church of Sant'Efisio overlooks a small piazza in which the rooms of the Archconfraternity of the Gonfalon, dedicated to the saint's worship, overlook. Alongside is a narrow street that flanks the parish church of Sant'Anna. At the centre of the simple facade, marked by three orders of Ionic pilasters, is the portal bordered by two false niches. Over a window. The order crowning is a curved tympanum topped in the form of an 'old-style Admiral's hat' framed by twin mouldings that meet in two volutes joined by a garland. The decoration in Piedmontese style recalls that of the nearby church of Santa Restituta, built a century earlier and the model for many Sardinian churches. Rising up on the right-hand side is a bell tower surmounted by a small dome covered with majolica, with the reconstruction dating back to the 16th-century. Within, on a single wide barrel-vaulted nave, open up three chapels on each side. The presbytery is raised and covered by a dome. The room is marked by classical decorations, such as pilasters and trabeations. The furnishing is typical of the late-18th century, especially the high altar in polychrome marble (1786). In the centre is a gilded wooden tabernacle in the shape of a temple, containing the relics of the warrior martyr. In a chapel to the right is preserved the 17th-century statue carried in the procession held on 1st May, whilst in the chapel dedicated to him is a second beautiful processional statue of the saint, by Giuseppe Antonio Lonis (1755), carried each Easter Monday to the cathedral of Santa Maria to thank the saint for defeating the fleet of French revolutionaries. Also within is a third 16th-century statue named Sant'Efis Sballiau ('mistaken'), as it depicts him with the palm of martyrdom on his right hand instead of on his left, as shown in the iconography. The nave is joined by the body of the large Cappella del Crocifisso, which can be accessed from the third arch on the right. A large canvas depicting the conversion of the saint stands in the centre of the vault. Other valuable works include a number of paintings and an Ecce Homo, a 17th-century sculpture characterised by great expressionism.\nA steep staircase carved into the rock leads to the crypt, traditionally the Efisiu Gloriosu prison. In Roman times, the hypogeum was likely used as a temple dedicated to the goddess Isis. A well in the middle of the floor would have contained the water for initiation rituals. In 1616, a tomb with a skeleton believed to be that of Sant'Edizio was discovered. Confirmation came from a marble slab on which was written bonae memoriae Editius."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Sant'Efisio martire", "description": "A martyr saint venerated in Sardinia", "types": ["Saint", "Martyr", "Religious Celebration"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true]}}, {"label": "Church of Sant'Efisio", "description": "A church located in the Stampace district of Cagliari, Sardinia", "types": ["Church", "Religious Building", "Baroque Architecture"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true]}}, {"label": "Archconfraternity of the Gonfalon", "description": "A religious organization dedicated to the worship of Sant'Efisio", "types": ["Religious Organization", "Worship", "Devotion"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true]}}, {"label": "Piedmont architect De Vincenti", "description": "An architect who worked on the restoration of the former Collegio Gesuita di Santa Croce in Cagliari", "types": ["Architect", "Restoration", "Historical Building"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, false, false]}}, {"label": "Church of Santa Restituta", "description": "A nearby church that served as a model for many Sardinian churches", "types": ["Church", "Architectural Model", "Historical Building"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true]}}, {"label": "Bell tower", "description": "A tower located on the right-hand side of the church, surmounted by a small dome covered with majolica", "types": ["Tower", "Bell Tower", "Architectural Element"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true]}}, {"label": "High altar", "description": "A polychrome marble altar located in the church, containing the relics of Sant'Efisio", "types": ["Altar", "Religious Object", "Relics"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, false]}}, {"label": "Giuseppe Antonio Lonis", "description": "A sculptor who created a processional statue of Sant'Efisio", "types": ["Sculptor", "Statue", "Procession"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, false, false]}}, {"label": "Cappella del Crocifisso", "description": "A large chapel located in the church, accessible from the third arch on the right", "types": ["Chapel", "Religious Building", "Vault"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true]}}, {"label": "Efisiu Gloriosu prison", "description": "A crypt located beneath the church, traditionally believed to be the prison in which Sant'Efisio was locked up before being martyred", "types": ["Crypt", "Prison", "Historical Site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true]}}, {"label": "Temple dedicated to the goddess Isis", "description": "A temple that was likely located in the hypogeum beneath the church during Roman times", "types": ["Temple", "Hypogeum", "Ancient Site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true]}}, {"label": "Tomb of Sant'Edizio", "description": "A tomb discovered in the crypt, believed to contain the skeleton of Sant'Efisio", "types": ["Tomb", "Crypt", "Historical Site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true]}}], "annotation": {"gpt missed": ["church of sant'anna", "cathedral of santa maria", "stampace district"]}}, "triples": {"gpt": [{"subject label": "Bell tower", "predicate label": "located on", "predicate description": "Expresses the position of an object in relation to another, indicating that the subject is situated on top of or attached to the object.", "object label": "Church of Sant'Efisio", "annotation": {"triple correctness": true, "relation from text": true}}, {"subject label": "High altar", "predicate label": "contains", "predicate description": "Expresses that the object is contained within the subject.

A quarry for limestone blocks, a Phoenician religious site, an amphora deposit, a place of Christian worship, and a shelter in the second world war. The crypt of Santa Restituta, one of the symbols of the picturesque neighbourhood of Stampace, has had a turbulent history, marked by periods of abandonment and with a happy ending in the restoration during the 1970s. The hypogeum has a central space connected to the outside by two stairways carved into the rock. The walls were once painted: the wall showing Saint John the Baptist with his right hand raised in blessing (13th century) still remains. The central altar features a marble statue of Santa Restituita, while the smaller altar used to hold simulacra of Saints Giusta, Giustina and Enedina. You can feel that the church is dug out of the rock as soon as you enter, from the small square of the same name a short walk from the Crypt of Sant'Efisio.\nPart of the building is a natural cave, and part is excavated. In the late-Punic period it was a limestone quarry. Findings of votive objects show that it later became a place of worship. The cave was also used during Roman and paleo-Christian times as a warehouse for amphorae up until the 1st century AD, before being abandoned for twelve centuries. In the 13th century it was consecrated to the African martyr Santa Restituita, whose relics had been held in Sardinia since the 5th century. It was then abandoned once more when the new and nearby churches of Sant'Anna and San Francesco were opened. It was rediscovered in the early 17th century. After finding the relics (1614), the bishop began work on improving the altar, creating three niches and the underground crypt with the martyr's column. The central aedicule held the relics of four saints. During the second world war, the hypogeum was used as bomb shelter during raids. The relics were hidden in Sant'Anna to protect them. There, they lay forgotten until they were rediscovered inside a 17th century urn in 1997.\nWhen touring the religious sites of Cagliari, other unmissable monuments include: Santa Maria cathedral and the Santuario dei Martiri, the basilica of Nostra Signora di Bonaria, a Christian temple in Sardinia, with its monumental cemetery and the paleo-Christian sanctuary of San Saturnino.\n\n"},

The Jesuit complex of San Michele is located in the upper part of the district of Stampace in Cagliari, near Porta dello Sperone. It consists of three buildings: the convent, preceded by a covered atrium and a vestibule, the former House of the novitiate, active since 1848 and currently the site of the military hospital, and the church, built at the end of the seventeenth century, before the cathedral, over a previous oratory, and consecrated in 1738. The Jesuits were expelled from the Island (1848) and returned to their church eighty years later.\nThe historical see of the Society of Jesus satisfies the ideological dictates of the powerful and cultured order. Despite the fact that the work lasted almost a century, the complex has a homogeneous appearance both in its architecture and decorations. The Baroque facade, made of tuff, has three orders. The first is divided by four fluted columns into three arcades that look out onto a cross-vaulted portico, from which you can enter the novitiate and the church. The second order is adorned by windows over which there are three coats of arms, of the Jesuit Society, of the commissioning bishop and (perhaps) the benefactor. The third, over which there is a triangular tympanum, is embellished by the niche in which there is a marble and bronze statue of St. Michael: the archangel is holding a sword and scales, symbols of strength and justice.\nOn the right, you will find the entrance to the church, an eighteenth century-inspired portal over which there is a gable end in the Genoese style of that period. Architectural lines, decorations, sculptures and paintings kept inside the church make it the most important testament to Baroque art in Cagliari. The plan is octagonal and irregular, with a single hall and four chapels on each side, communicating with each other. You will be struck by the rich decoration: sculpted stone elements, stuccoes, frescoes and multi-coloured marbles form a large part of the decor. The walls are punctuated by fluted parastades, adorned with friezes of leaves and human figures and on top of which there is a cornice along the entire perimeter. The cupola is resting on an octagonal tambour in which there are four windows. The roof has overlapping tiles (arranged like fish scales) and, on top of it, there is a lantern.\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, a rectangular sacristy was added, in Rococo style, with furniture, flooring, frescoes, portals, paintings, among which the Mysteries of the Rosary, and wooden sculptures, namely the Mysteries of the Passion by Sardinian artist Giuseppe Antonio Lonis, which are carried in the procession during the Holy Week rituals in Cagliari."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Jesuit complex of San Michele", "description": "A complex of three buildings consisting of a convent, a former House of the novitiate, and a church, located in Cagliari, Sardinia.", "types": ["Historical site", "Religious complex", "Baroque architecture"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true]}}, {"label": "Convent", "description": "A building that is part of the Jesuit complex of San Michele, located in Cagliari, Sardinia.", "types": ["Religious building", "Baroque architecture"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "House of the novitiate", "description": "A building that is part of the Jesuit complex of San Michele, located in Cagliari, Sardinia.

A large green space in the historic centre of Cagliari is home to thousands of plant species from all over the world, some of them very rare, and at its core is an archaeological area that houses a large number of Roman remains. The Botanical Gardens are shaped like a trapezoid and cover an area of about five hectares at the lower end of the Palabenda valley, in an area that includes the Anfiteatro romano, Orto dei cappuccini vegetable garden and villa di Tigellio, where there are other Roman domus remains and what was once a thermal baths. The idea of creating a botanical garden in the valley came about in 1820. It had once belonged to the Jesuits, then to the ruling family, to a series of private individuals and was then purchased by the university. Work on the project began in 1864 under the guidance of the founder Patrizio Gennari, who modified the original project designed by the architect Gaetano Cima.\nHis touch can be seen at the far end of the valley, which is graced with a series of symmetrical lawns on either side of a main path that leads from the entrance to the fountain of the central square and then on to a pool with a majestic 'marsh cypress' and Fontana Pampanini. It is here that you'll see the oldest of the garden's plants. On the left hand side of the main path are desert succulents separated into plants from Africa and neotropical flora, and the arecaceae (palms) of the palm tree stand, where an oasis habitat has been created. To the right is a Mediterranean woods, with bushes and trees typical to the Mediterranean wilderness, and an herb garden that is home to commonly used medicinal plants that even science considers the most efficient in terms of herbal cures. A new section devoted to geophytes was very recently (2009) added and boasts some 200 species. A stairway leads from the lowermost part of the garden back up. The Gennari Grotto, the clover pool, the Roman cave, the raised walkway, the germplasm bank and the botanical museum are all also well worth a visit. And you must stop in at the Roccaglie biodiversity area, a display set up in 2004 that recreates the conditions under which a variety of plants grow in a rocky terrain in nature. Some 90% of the endemic, rare and threatened species from western Mediterranean islands, particularly Sardinia, are preserved here. Each section is divided into thematic subdivisions."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Botanical garden - Cagliari", "description": "A large green space in the historic centre of Cagliari that houses

A parallel city exists inside modern-day Cagliari, partially set into the urban weave and entirely visible, and partially hidden from sight. Cagliari's thousands of years of history is a constant journey of discovery, to be studied, to be admired. Karales was one of the most important - if not the most important - Roman city of Sardinia. Set in a strategic position, it was an essential stop on the Mediterranean Sea and a flourishing city of commerce during Rome's Imperial Age. Its original Phoenician name was Karalis, bearing witness to the town of vicus Karalis built adjacent to the pre-existing Punic city just after the Roman conquest of Sardinia in 238 BCE. In the 2nd century BCE, its name changed from the singular (Karalis) to the plural (Karales) indicating that the two cities had become one single urban centre. The city's architecture then underwent further change partly due to Roman emperor Octavian's statute, the municipium Julium civium Romanorum (38 BCE). During Rome's Imperial Age, it enjoyed a tremendous burst of urban development with the construction of public buildings and private residences.\nThanks to documents and archaeological finds, historians and archaeologists have been able to recreate a map of the ancient city. The old city centre is the modern-day Castello and Stampace districts. What is now Piazza del Carmine used to be the old Forum, surrounded by temples and thermal baths. The most spacious 2nd century BCE baths have been discovered on Largo Carlo Felice and on Viale Trieste. Along what is now Via Malta, a temple-theatre from the Late Republican Age has come to light. Patrician homes were built nearby, on today's Corso Vittorio Emanuele and the Sant'Avendrace district, as well as in the area where, some centuries later, the Basilica of San Saturnino was erected. The commercial hub and public housing were located near the port, now known as the Marina. The necropolis, where the Phoenicians had also buried their dead, were outside of the city limits on the hills of Tuvixeddu and Bonaria, where other patrician homes were also located. An aqueduct brought water into the city from Siliqua. The most celebrated and eye-catching remains span the southern slope of Buoncammino hill, the Roman Amphitheatre. After centuries of neglect and its repurposing as a quarry, it has now regained its role as public theatre. Six hundred metres separate it from a residential complex known as villa di Tigellio, a poet and cantor from the Augustinian period. The residence is actually the union of three domus: the \"house of plaster,\" so named for the rich plaster embellishments that decorated its walls; the \"house of the painted panel\", graced with the remains of a mosaic floor; and, finally, the remains of what was once a thermal building. Another highly visible Roman landmark is the grotta della Vipera, so called for the serpents carved into the sides of its facade. It is a funereal monument built between the 1st and 2nd centuries CE by the exiled Lucio Cassio Filippo in memory of his wife, Atilia Pomptilla. Legend has it that she offered her life to the gods in exchange for healing her gravely ill husband. The sacrifice worked. The facade of the tomb had a pediment with a tympanum and two columns, although today only a capital remains. Inside, there are two burial chambers and a pronaos, in which the story of the couple is inscribed in Greek and Latin on a wall. No less interesting are the city's 'hidden' traces, sometimes located in the basements of churches and modern buildings. The parochial church of Sant'Eulalia sits over a stretch of paved road, the remains of complex buildings and of a temple. A fullonica (a workshop for washing and dying cloth) graced with a mosaic floor emerges in the basement of a palazzo on Viale Regina Margherita. You'll see cisterns and storage areas in the crypt of Santa Restituita and at the top of the Sella del Diavolo, or Devil's Saddle. And, finally, some of the cavities at the orto dei cappuccini, once a quarry for the extraction of the limestone used in the construction of the amphitheatre, were repurposed as cisterns and, later, in all probability, as jail cells."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Karales", "description": "An ancient Roman city in Sardinia", "types": ["Historical City", "Archaeological Site"], "annotation":

"text": "Anfiteatro romano di Cagliari; . Mentioned in 19th century letters and studies, the Roman amphitheatre in Cagliari was rediscovered during the Romantic period, with its passion for the ruins of ancient civilisations.The first excavations by canon Giovanni Spano (1866-68) were followed by archaeologist Doro Levi's digs (1937-38) and the restoration of the majestic building.\nDuring the first imperial age, neighbourhoods and public buildings were built in Carales, followed by the amphitheatre from the late 1st and early 2nd centuries AD, set in the southern foothills of the Buoncammino hill. It originally occupied more than a thousand square metres, with a 120 metre perimeter and a 20 metre high facade decorated with columns and statues. Part of the stands (cavea), the arena, corridors and other areas were carved from the rock, while the rest was built using white limestone blocks.\nToday you can admire part of the cavea and underneath, the gladiators' rooms, the cells for the animals and the infirmary. These were the times of the games. The stands, on three levels, could hold ten thousand spectators of all social classes, who could watch fights between men and beasts imported from Africa in the morning, executions at lunchtime, and in the evening, after the banquets, the most popular event of all: fights between gladiators recruited from the island and elsewhere, who underwent arduous training in what is now the Orto deiCappuccini. Imagine the stands full and the illustrious decuriones sitting on the podium with its marble paving, sheltered from the sun by the velarium.\nThe amphitheatre was also used to collect rainwater: the funnel-shaped cavea allowed the water to flow into a well. With the arrival of Christianity, the gladiator fights lost popularity until they were banned by law in 438 AD. The building was then used as a quarry. The site continued to be despoiled until the 19th century. Today it is partly covered by a structure in iron and wood that was used to host shows and concerts from 2000 to 2011, before the long and difficult process of restoring it as an archaeological site began. In your tour of Roman Cagliari, in addition to the amphitheatre you'll also find private homes such as the Villa di Tigellio. Nearby, don't miss the Botanic Gardens, a green oasis in the heart of the city, or the Roman remains preserved in the CitadelladeiMusei, Sardinia's largest and most complete museum complex.\n"},

This temple is a symbol of the religious and socio-cultural integration of the Castello, the fulcrum of Cagliari, from the 13th and 19th centuries. The Basilica di Santa Croce can be explored whilst strolling through the heart of the city, upon entering into the medieval quarter from the Saint Remy bastion. After crossing the Torre dell'Elefante and going along the Santa Croce bastion in the direction of the Ghetto degli Ebrei, a stretch of a small piazza can be spied, preceded by a few steps and enclosed by the houses of the former Jewish quarter. Here, one faces the monumental facade of the basilica, which was reopened for worship in 2007 after decades of restoration. It is difficult to photograph the entire slender facade, given that one can only take a limited number of steps backward within the churchyard. The feeling of majesty increases once inside, with a single nave that is barrel vaulted and decorated with faux ceiling coffers by Ludovico Crespi.\nThere are three chapels on each side, also barrel-vaulted, decorated with baroque altars in polychrome marble, with sculptures and paintings from the 17th and 18th centuries. The presbytery is enriched by a high altar, guarded over by a wooden Crucified Christ, and closed by a semi-circular apse, on which Antonio frescoed the Saints Mauritius and Lazarus (1842). The facade is divided into two levels, with the lower one opening the portal, surmounted by a curved tympanum, and the upper one being distinguished by pilasters and bordered by two obelisks. Another peculiarity is the two bell towers. One is parallel to the facade, the other is near the presbytery, with a square-barrelled tower and an oriental dome. The history of the church, originally having been a synagogue, is intrinsically linked to the village, once the Giudaria of Cagliari, which reached its maximum expansion under Aragonese rule, before Ferdinand II banished from the territories of the Crown any Jewish and Muslim people who did not convert to Christianity (1492). The synagogue became a Catholic church and was granted to an archconfraternity, whose noble members were committed to comforting those condemned to death. In 1564, Archbishop Parragues, in order to promote cultural growth in the city, called upon the Jesuits, who were granted the church and adjacent houses, which became the College of the Company of Jesus. Thanks to the legacy left to them by the noblewoman Anna Brondo, the building was expanded and radically transformed. An inscription on the facade shows that the works were completed in 1661. At the end of the 18th century, Pope Clement XIV suppressed the Jesuits and the complex passed to the State. Finally, at the beginning of the 19th century, King Vittorio Emanuele I promoted the church to the rank of Masterful Basilica and entrusted it to the knightly order of the Saints Mauritius and Lazarus, to whom it still belongs. Throughout the centuries, the former college rather became the Monte di Pieta, a printing house, a Court, Court of Appeal, Faculty of Literature and, today, of Architecture."}, "entities": {"gpt":

The 'prelude' is the Ethnographic Museum, where you will be astounded by the Sardinian artefacts and jewellery of the Cocco collection. Going further into the Picture Gallery, take some time to ponder over the details of the wonderful retables, ancient traditional Hispanic altarpieces, made by the Maestro di Castelsardo and by the Cagliari workshop of Pietro Cavaro. The expert hands of artisans have impressed the stories of saints onto wood, with elegant decorations and bright colours.\nThe first large exhibition centre was supplemented by various donations, among which an ethnographic collection, including splendid fabrics and furniture, pottery, arms and a bronze bird-shaped ewer (12th century), similar to another one kept at the Louvre in Paris. There are another two permanent exhibitions: the Clemente Susini Museum of Anatomical Waxes and the Stefano Cardu Siamese Museum, in which valuable pieces will accompany you on a virtual journey to the East.\nThe Citadel also hosts temporary exhibitions throughout the year, as well as conferences and cultural events.

When you fly into Cagliari, it is impossible not to notice its cupola. The cathedral of Santa Maria, the place of worship that is the symbol of the city, together with the basilica of Bonaria, stands out in the Castello neighbourhood its majestic bulk, flanked by Palazzo Regio and the ancient Palazzo di Citta. The church is 35 metres long, 34 metres wide and 32 metres high, and was built with gothic-Romanesque forms. It was first mentioned in 1255: its patron saint was Saint Cecilia (it was later assigned to Santa Maria). Between the 13th and 14th centuries, it was expanded, but its current appearance is the result of Catalan-Aragonese interventions that lasted four centuries. The baroque marble facade dates back to 1704, inspired on the cathedrals of Lucca and Pisa, was dismantled in the vain hopes of finding the medieval facade beneath. It was replaced by a neo-Romanesque marble structure in 1931.\nIts baroque shapes date back to works carried out between 1669 and 1674: the central nave was augmented and support pillars were built to support the new, higher roof and the famous cupola. The works have given the Duomo a slander physiognomy, enhancing its majestic appearance. Of the original Pisa construction, the belfry, counter-facade, perimeter walls of the transept and the two side portals are all that remain.\nIt has a Latin cross plant: three naves and transept, marble floor and chapels enriched with works such as silver tabernacle and the Sacred Thorn. Leaning against the wall of the central nave sits Guglielmo's pulpit, sculpted for the cathedral of Pisa and later transferred to Cagliari (1312). Another very valuable piece is the Madonna col Bambino (The Virgin and Child), a golden wooden sculpture (14th century), the silver lamp by Giovanni Mameli (1602) and the paintings on the central ceiling, by Filippo Figari. Beneath the alter lies the Sanctuary of the Martyrs, a crypt dug into the rock (1618), which preserves 192 relics, distributed in niches, the works of master craftsmen from Cagliari and Sicily. The sacristy preserves the treasure of the cathedral: in particular, the Triptych of Clemens VII, attributed to a Flemish workshop (15th century), the Retablo dei Beneficiati, a creation of Neapolitan artists, and the marvellous paliotto by Palermo silver artists.\n\n\n\n"}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Cathedral of Santa Maria di Castello", "description": "A gothic-Romanesque cathedral in

You probably won't examine each and every one of the nearly 200 niches containing the relics of saints, but your visit to the crypt of the Santa Maria Cathedral, located in Piazza Palazzo in Cagliari, will be unforgettable. Truth is, no other church in Europe can boast anything like it. Aside from admiring the sheer elegance and splendour of the Baroque decorations, you'll also be amazed at what brought about its construction: an archbishop-archaeologist wanted to be the primate of the Sardinian Church. Throughout history, relics have always been objects of deep veneration and great prestige. This was true for the early 1600s as well. The archbishop of Sassari could boast those of saints Gavino, Proto and Gianuario in the basilica of Porto Torres, thus claiming the title of Primate of the Sardinian Church. But the archbishop of Cagliari, Francisco d'Esquivel, from a noble Spanish family, disagreed. So, he searched and found the burial places of all the saints of Cagliari. In order to preserve and venerate them, he had the Shrine of the Martyrs built, a crypt dug into the rock under the cathedral's presbytery. In 192 separate niches he placed the relics of the martyrs, each with a marble plaque bearing their name and the symbols of their martyrdom in bas relief.\nThe sanctuary was inaugurated in 1618 and adorned with polychromatic marble, some 600 rose windows and renaissance, baroque and neoclassical works of art. The marble sarcophagus of the archbishop, and a 17th century painting portraying the Crucifixion, sit on the landing. The crypt comprises three chapels. In the Madonna dei Martiri chapel there are 66 niches. Above the altar is a statue of a Madonna with Child, between San Giuseppe and Sant'Anna. In the San Lucifero chapel, named after the 4th century bishop of Cagliari, are another 80. The bones of the saint are under the top of the altar, upon which sits a statue of him. There is also a Roman sarcophagus that holds the bones of Sant'Antioco, and the white marble mausoleum of Maria Giuseppina of Savoy, wife of France's King Louis XVIII. The chapel of San Saturnino, dedicated to the patron saint of Cagliari, dates to 1620 and contains 33 niches. Above the altar is a Roman (2nd century BCE) sarcophagus that was found in the basilica of San Saturnino. His relics rest inside. Two other sarcophagi house another 19 saints. At the back you'll find the mausoleum of Carlo Emanuele of Savoy, who was 2 when he died, made in 1799 by Antonio Cano. Two marble lunettes dating to the early 1700s depict San Pietro and the Madonna del Carmine.\ne."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "The Shrine of the Martyrs", "description": "A crypt containing the

One of Cagliari's most beautiful green areas stretches across a ridge of the Buoncammino hill: a sort of 'hanging garden', with a long, spectacular tree-lined avenue. At the end of the avenue, you will notice the elegant Neoclassical facade of the former royal munitions depot, which has accommodated the Municipal Art Gallery since 1933. The military building was destroyed by an explosion and was rebuilt in 1828 based on a design by military engineer Carlo Boyl. After a century of use as a barracks and a warehouse and after further modernisation works, it became a museum. After crossing the garden, before entering, you can admire the facade of the building, with limestone friezes and a tympanum with three statues carved in Carrara marble above it.\nInside the 'gallery' there are two main exhibition areas: the first is the Ingrao collection, donated to the Municipality of Cagliari in 1999, which contains works by the greatest Italian masters of the 20th century, including Umberto Boccioni - with 31 works including paintings and drawings -, Giorgio Morandi and Mino Maccari. About 650 works form a collection of the main artistic trends of the last century and are kept in the rooms called 'the collector's rooms'. In the second area, you can admire the most important collection of works by Sardinian artists, especially between the early 20th century and the late 1970s. The artists represented, including the main personalities on the Sardinian artistic scene, went on a search for harmony between the ideas of contemporary art and the island's cultural context. One room is dedicated to the plaster sculptures of Francesco Ciusa, including the famous 'madre dell'ucciso' (mother of the slain). Among the 74 works on show, there are also creations by Pinuccio Sciola, Costantino Nivola and Maria Lai. A collection of Sardinian ethnographic materials from the late 18th century and a large collection of prints are also on display.\nThe 'gallery' also accommodates the library specialised in the history of art and the 'Reading Garden', an initiative that allows you to borrow books and newspapers and read them outdoors. Educational courses, activities for children, meetings and cultural reviews are periodically promoted. The rooms are accessible to the blind.\nThe cultural itinerary can continue to the fortifications of the Castle district, crossing the spectacular Porta di San Pancrazio, to reach the Citadel of Museums, the ancient site of the royal arsenal and today the largest museum centre in Sardinia, which includes the National Archaeological Museum, the Museum of Siamese Art, the Anatomical Wax Museum,

Cagliari's Palazzo Civico, or City Hall, rises above the harbour like a bastion of white stone, elegant in shape and colours, perfectly in tune with the other old buildings that line Via Roma. City Hall was originally located at Piazza Palazzo in the Castello quarter, fortified higher part of the city and symbol of its defence. Thanks a the far-sighted initiative of Mayor Ottone Bacaredda, the city's main institution was moved to the more popular Marina quarter adjacent to the Stampace quarter by the seashore, a sign of changing times. In 1896 the city's councilmen had deliberated that the seat of government should leave the city walls and head down towards the harbour. The building's design was based on a Gothic-Catalan model and constructed with white calcareous rock graced with art deco embellishments. It was solemnly inaugurated in 1907. The move was an expression of a new political trend that reflected the ideas of the business class: visibility, comparison and openness, a radical departure from aristocratic pride and diffidence. Cagliari presented itself to the world as a modern city with an impressive 'visiting card': a new City Hall that was not spared the bombing raids of WWII and thus rebuilt between 1946 and 1953.\nThe building can be visited like a museum and occupies a city block set between Via Roma, where the main entrance is, Via Crispi, Angiogi and Largo Carlo Felice. The facade is graced by a portico of seven arches plus the central arch, which leads to the courtyard. At the top are two 38-metre high octagonal towers, while four obelisks decorated with the heads of the Four Moors adorn the corners. Works in bronze by Andrea Valli grace the prospects: an eagle holding up the city's emblem, two lions and allegorical representations of Agriculture, Commerce and Industry. A two ramps of stairs lead to the upper floor. In the Consiglio hall are three important works by artist Filippo Figari. The nearby Giunta hall is home to the Gonfalone and the XVI-century retable of the Consiglieri. In the Wedding Hall is a work by Figari depicting a Sardinian wedding, as well as a variety of beautifully crafted artisanal furniture. There are also jewels, archaeological relics and the simulacrum of St. Agostino. In the mayor's room is a large 1620 Flemish tapestry, and in the Savoy room three works by Maghinotti: portraits of Vittorio Emanuele II, of Carlo Alberto and his arrival in Cagliari in 1840."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "City Hall", "description": "The main institution of Cagliari's government, located in the Marina quarter adjacent to the Stampace quarter by the seashore.", "types": ["Government building", "Museum"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Palazzo Civico", "description": "The Italian name for City Hall, a Gothic-Catalan style building constructed with white calcareous rock graced with art deco embellishments.", "types": ["Government building", "Museum"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Ottone Bacaredda", "description": "The far-sighted mayor who initiated the move of City Hall from the Castello quarter to the Marina quarter.", "types": ["Politician"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Piazza Palazzo", "description": "The original location of City Hall in the Castello quarter, fortified higher part of the city and symbol of its defence.", "types": ["Square"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Via Roma", "description": "The street where the main entrance of City Hall is located.", "types": ["Street"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Art deco", "description": "A decorative style characterized by geometric shapes, bold colors, and lavish ornamentation.", "types": ["Art style"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "WWII", "description": "An abbreviation for World War II, a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945.", "types": ["Historical event"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Andrea Valli", "description": "The artist who created the bronze works gracing the prospects of City Hall, including an eagle holding up the city's emblem, two lions, and allegorical representations of Agriculture, Commerce, and Industry.", "types": ["Artist"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Filippo Figari", "description": "The artist who created three important works in the Consiglio hall of City Hall and a work depicting a Sardinian wedding in the Wedding Hall.", "types": ["Artist"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Giunta hall", "description": "A hall in City Hall that houses the Gonfalone and the XVI-century retable of the Consiglieri.", "types": ["Hall", "Museum"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Flemish tapestry", "description": "A large tapestry from Flanders, created in 1620, that hangs in the mayor's room of City Hall.", "types": ["Artwork"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Maghinotti", "description": "The artist who created three works in the Savoy room of City Hall, including portraits of Vittorio Emanuele II, of Carlo Alberto, and his arrival in Cagliari in 1840.", "types": ["Artist"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}], "annotation": {"gpt missed": []}}, "triples": {"gpt": [{"subject label": "City Hall", "predicate label": "is_named", "predicate description": "Expresses the relationship between a named entity and its name.

The church of San Sepolcro, in the heart of the district of Marina di Cagliari, has an ancient and fascinating history, which probably began in the 14th century and is linked, according to some scholars, to the figures of the Knights Templar and, above all, to the events of the Confraternity of the Most Holy Crucifix, also known as that of the Oration or of the Good Death, a religious order established in 1564, engaged above all in giving a respectable burial to the corpses of poor people and outcasts.\nIn 1992, on the occasion of renovation work carried out under the surface: a large room full of earth mixed with human bones was found. In fact, before the edict of Saint Cloud (1805) issued by Napoleon, bodies were buried within the town walls. It may have been these same religious brothers who dealt with the burials and it seems that they had Roman catacombs brought from the Holy Land so that the deceased could be united with the holy martyrs for eternity.\nThe crypt tells the story of a past of solitude and alienation and of charitable and considerate people who wanted to ensure that the poor and the unfortunate would have a tomb. The Crypta del Santo Sepolcro (Crypt of the Holy Sepulchre) is one of the most fascinating underground spaces in the town. As soon as you cross the entrance to the church, you will reach the crypt via a trapdoor situated in the centre of the nave: going down a short flight of steps, you will enter the three barrel-vaulted rooms that make up the underground vault. The spaces were probably dug out of the rock and burial took place on the floor using mounds of earth. The main room is painted completely black, using the technique of charcoal tempera paint, as if the walls were covered in gloomy drapes. In one of the rooms, you will see a masonry sepulchre, perhaps destined for the body of an illustrious character. You will notice traces of frescoes on the walls: the most significant painting depicts 'Death' portrayed as a skeleton wrapped in a regal ermine robe, with an hourglass in one hand, a symbol of the passing of time, and a scythe in the other.

The current building dates back to the 18th century and stands on the site of pre-existing building, namely the chapel of an ancient hospital, dating back to the 14th century, and an integral part of a convent.\nThe facade has a large mixtilinear portal with a rich cornice decorated with mouldings, bearing the coat of arms of the Spedalieri di San Giovanni di Dio (Hospitallers of St John of God). Over it, there is a niche containing the statue of the saint, next to which there is a piglet, demonstrating the saint's devotion towards wayfarers and animals. At one time, it was customary to bring animals here on 17 January, on the anniversary in celebration of the saint, to have them blessed.\nThe interior has an octagonal layout with a dome roof and six lateral chapels, framed by parastades and with barrel vaults. The decoration is late Baroque style, with green plasterwork, on which golden stuccoes stand out. In the presbytery, there is a multi-coloured marble altar. Both that in the presbytery and the alters of the two chapels are the work of the sculptor Giovanbattista Troiani, while the exquisite paintings, among which one from the Sixteenth century, dedicated to the Madonna of Itria, are attributed to Ursino Buoncora. Along the portico of Sant'Antonio, that joins the church to the ancient hospital, you can see the remains of blocked openings, as well as a series of medieval coats of arms set in the wall.\nFrom via

Large parts of the old system of towers and bastions, built to protect the town, are still remaining and today, thanks to the panoramic views of the town they offer, you can spend pleasant, relaxing moments. From elegant terraces, in one of Cagliari's highest areas, you can sip an aperitif while enjoying the breathtaking views. Not far from the fortifications, you will find the main shopping streets.\nBetween 1491 and 1508, a bastion was built on the hill of the Castello district and was the seat of the town's civil and religious authorities for centuries. In 1534, a boundary wall was built between the Tower of the Elephant and the Church of Santa Croce, a former synagogue converted into a Catholic place of worship in 1492. The Bastion of Santa Croce is now an elegant terrace, an elegant terrace and centre of nightlife, overlooking the Stampace district and facing the deep blue sea of the port.\nThe Tower of San Pancrazio, built in 1305 by architect Giovanni Capula, was constructed in sandstone, white limestone extracted from the Bonaria hill, where the splendid basilica of the same name stands. At the base of the tower, the gate of San Pancrazio opens up, allowing you to enter the Castello district.\nThe Tower of the Elephant was built two years later. Its name comes from the statue of the pachyderm, symbol of the city, positioned on a corbel on the external part, facing towards the port. Divided into four levels, you will be struck by the majesty of the great portcullis which is raised, but ready to close the entrance door to the old district.

Gateway from the Villanova quarter to the fortifications of Castello in the heart of the old city, the bastion that owes its name to the Baron of San Remy, the first Viceroy of Piedmont, looks out over Piazza Costituzione where the two streets that have historically been havens of leisurely strolls and shopping, via Garibaldi and via Manno, come together. It is without doubt a symbol of Cagliari, one of its finest and most majestic monumental complexes, as well as its most prestigious exhibition space.\nThe covered gallery and the marvellous Umberto I terrace were designed by Giuseppe Costa and Fulgenzio Setti based on an idea developed by the XIX-century architect Gaetano Cima. It was built in a Classic style between 1896 and 1902 on the old city's medieval bastions. The San Remy Bastion is the result of the levelling and reuse of the old Sperone and Zecca bastions that had been built by the Spaniards in the late XVI century.\nThe imposing structure features yellow and white calcareous columns topped with Corinthian capitals. The main stairway is long and complex, going upwards from the piazza with a series of ramps that come together halfway up at a wide terrace. From here you can gain access to the gallery, which unites large, bright rooms decorated with lively colours and enclosed with high arches. Under the main arch that dominates the building is another stairs with two circular ramps that lead to the Umberto I terrace, from which you can enjoy magnificent views over the entire city and the sea. The square is home to two more ramps of stairs that lead to the Bastione di Santa Caterina.\nThe stairs and the triumphant arch, damaged by bombs in WWII, were faithfully reconstructed starting in 1946. Over the years, the wide open spaces of the gallery were adapted to a variety of functions: initially for use as banquet halls, then as an infirmary during the war, and later as a refuge for the homeless. In 1948 it hosted the first edition of the international Sardinia Fair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Saint Remy Bastion", "description": "A monumental complex and exhibition

From the Punic sacrarium to the remains of the late Republic and Imperial Roman city, from the 14th-century Catalan-Aragonese churches passing to the 20th century when, after the bombardments of World War II, the medieval district of the Marina and its monuments were restored to new life. The Sant'Eulalia (Mutseu) museum consists of a journey stretching over 2,000 years through the history of Cagliari, especially in the ancient nucleus built near the port, which includes countless monuments - the parish church of Sant'Eulalia, a church dedicated to the patron saint of Barcelona (later enlarged and modernised), the archaeological area below, the Museo del Tesoro, the parish archives, the monumental crypt (16th-17th centuries) and the excavations beneath the church of Santa Lucia. The museum, set up in a building adjacent to the parish, preserves the extensive artistic heritage of the churches of Sant'Eulalia, Santa Lucia and Santo Sepolcro and the archival material of the parish and archconfraternities of the Crucifix and the Holy Trinity, active between the 17th and early-20th centuries.\nThe first floor holds the artistic exhibition, rendered sumptuous by the many works commissioned by the wealthy congregation of the Santissimo Sacramento. The silver room contains liturgical items, with some artefacts being examples of Ligurian-Piedmont baroque, whilst others hail from Sardinian workshops (16th-19th century). One magnificent item is a baroque chalice from 1673. The precious vestments once belonged to popes and archbishops. The 17th-century 'Planet of Passion', depicting Jesus praying in the garden of Gethsemane and in the praetorian, is absolutely splendid. A late-18th century vestment with the Zapata family coat of arms and the Arciconfraternita del Santo Sepolcro (Archconfraternity of the Holy Sepulchre) is simply beautiful. Amongst the paintings, you will be enraptured by an Ecce Homo with a Flagelled Christ, attributed to Giovanni Bilevelt, a Flemish painter who worked in Sassari at the beginning of the 17th century. Of great significance is the 14th-century oval panel of the Madonna and Child, of the Tuscan school. Amongst the wooden statues by the Sardinian carvers and Neapolitan workshops from the 17th and 18th centuries, the 'Madonna degli Abbandonati' is a stand out. Other important sculptures include the San Giovanni Nepomuceno from the Lonis workshop, the 17th century Regina Angelorum, the damask statue of Santa Lucia and the 18th-century processional cross with mother-of-pearl inlays. On the ground floor is the archive safeguarding 33 parchments of the Holy Sepulchre, the accounting records documenting the management of the patrimony and other documents attesting to the work of the congregations.\nThe museum pathway also includes an archaeological area that was discovered under Sant'Eulalia, with an overlapping of multiple phases of use, from the time of the Roman Republic to the modern era. Excavations have focused on the subsoil of the museum and church (900 square metres), revealing an original image of ancient Cagliari and the early Middle Ages. In the late Punic age (IV-III B.C.) there was a sanctuary, in use until the beginning of the Roman-Imperial age (1 B.C.). Along the evocative underground route, there are 13 metres of paved road, probably connected to the port activities of the time, and the remains of an area enclosed by a colonnade resting on marble bases.\n"}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Treasure Museum and Archaeological Area of Sant'Eulalia", "description": "A museum and archaeological site in Cagliari, Sardinia, showcasing the history of the city from the Punic era to the modern era.", "types": ["Museum", "Archaeological site", "Historical site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true]}}, {"label": "Parish Church of Sant'Eulalia", "description": "A church dedicated to the patron saint of Cagliari, located in the ancient nucleus built near the port.", "types": ["Church", "Historical site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": false, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Church of Santa Lucia", "description": "A church located in the ancient nucleus built near the port, with excavations beneath it.", "types": ["Church", "Historical site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Church of Santo Sepolcro", "description": "A church located in the ancient nucleus built near the port, with archival material of the Archconfraternity of the Holy Sepulchre.", "types": ["Church", "Historical site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Museo del Tesoro", "description": "A museum located in a building adjacent to the parish, preserving the extensive artistic heritage of the churches of Sant'Eulalia, Santa Lucia, and Santo Sepolcro.", "types": ["Museum", "Art gallery"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Archaeological area", "description": "An area discovered under Sant'Eulalia, showcasing the history of Cagliari from the Punic era to the modern era.", "types": ["Archaeological site", "Historical site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Liturgical items", "description": "Items used in religious ceremonies, such as chalices and vestments.", "types": ["Religious items", "Artifacts"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Artistic exhibition", "description": "An exhibition on the first floor of the museum, showcasing works commissioned by the congregation of the Santissimo Sacramento.", "types": ["Art exhibition", "Art gallery"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, false]}}, {"label": "Silver room", "description": "A room in the museum containing liturgical items made of silver.", "types": ["Artifacts", "Religious items"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [false, false]}}, {"label": "Vestments", "description": "Clothing worn by religious officials during ceremonies.", "types": ["Religious items", "Clothing"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Paintings", "description": "Artworks created using paint.", "types": ["Artworks", "Paintings"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Wooden statues", "description": "Statues made of wood, created by Sardinian carvers and Neapolitan workshops from the 17th and 18th centuries.", "types": ["Artworks", "Statues"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Archival material", "description": "Documents and records related to the history of the churches and congregations.", "types": ["Archives", "Historical documents"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [false, true]}}], "annotation": {"gpt missed": []}}, "triples": {"gpt": [{"subject label": "Treasure Museum and Archaeological Area of Sant'Eulalia", "predicate label": "includes", "predicate description": "Expresses that the subject contains or encompasses the object.

It is the parish church in the historical district of Villanova, at the foot of the Castle, and one of the four most ancient parishes in Cagliari. The church of San Giacomo is located in the square of the same name, at the end of two of the town's famous shopping streets, Via Garibaldi and Via Sulis, and flanked by the facades of the oratories of the Anime (Souls) and of the Santissimo Crocifisso (Holy Crucifix). The first mention of it is in the ordinances of the Councilors of the Castle (1346). It was probably built around that date. A century later it was flanked by the square bell tower, thirty metres high, as is written on a plaque placed at its base. The temple, one of the first examples of Gothic-Catalan architecture in Sardinia, was renovated between the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1630, its rank was elevated to collegiate church. It was consecrated in 1781. The church of San Giacomo, in the capital, acted as a model for various churches in the central-southern part of the Island, between the 15th and 17th centuries, among which the parish churches of Assemini, Atzara, Sestu and Settimo San Pietro.\nThe Gothic-Catalan facade was replaced during modifications, which took place in the 19th century, by the current neoclassical purist forms, work of the famous architect Gaetano Cima: it is divided horizontally by springcourse cornices and vertically by four sturdy columns with smooth shafts and Corinthian capitals, supporting a triangular tympanum. At the centre, there is a wooden entrance door with lunettes. The interior, which underwent alterations in the eighteenth-century, has maintained its original Gothic layout with one nave and a barrel-vaulted ceiling supported by parastades. You can admire five chapels on each side, almost all with ribbed cross vaults, except for two that have a dome ceiling. On the left side, the first chapel contains an exquisite 15th-century terracotta Lamentation, while the style of the third chapel, dedicated to the Crucifix, is Baroque, like the chapel of the Sacred Heart, second on the right. On the multi-coloured marble altar, which is the work of Giovanni Battista (18th century), you will notice a group of wooden sculptures, also created in the 15th century, made up of a crucifix and statues of the devout women under the cross. The area of the presbytery, which is raised and enclosed by a marble balustrade, consists of a typical Catalan capilla mayor, with a beautiful star-shaped vault and hanging gems. The church also contains an exquisite organ dating back to 1769."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "San Giacomo", "description": "Parish church in the historical district of Villanova, Cagliari",

Faith and mystery seep from its pure white stones, that cry out the tragic story of the young Saturnino (Saturno in some sources), who was decapitated in 304 AD for refusing to deny his Christian faith. The basilica where the martyr, who is the patron saint of Cagliari, was buried still has its original appearance of a martyrium. This is the oldest church in the capital, built in Byzantine-Proto-Romanic style between the 5th and 6th century: together with the necropolis on which it was built, it is one of the most important paleo-Christian complexes in the Mediterranean. Excavations have found Roman and Byzantine burials, and you'll be amazed by the size of the cemetery.\nThe ancient building is laid out in the form of a Greek cross, with four equal-length arms and a central body topped with a dome, which remains intact together with the remains of the apse. After sinking into the quiet inside, you can admire the finesse of the external decorations on the central nave, along with the only remaining Romanic door on the eastern wing, with a late-Romanic arch.\nThe original layout was extended and transformed six centuries after the first stone was laid. In 1089, the Judge of Cagliari donated the ruins to the Vittorini from Marseille, who made it their convent. The ex-martyrium was renovated according to typical Provencal Romanic standards, with a four-nave basilica, barrel vaulted ceiling and central dome. Thirty years later, in 1119, the church was re-consecrated. In 1714, it was also dedicated to Saints Cosma and Damiano when it was transferred to the Medici e Speziali corporation. The history of San Saturnino in the previous and subsequent centuries was an alternation of restoration, excavations looking for the relics of martyrs (or presumed martyrs), dismantling in order to use the material for the Cattedrale di Santa Maria and the Castello di San Michele, and damage during the second world war. Lastly, it was restored in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, recreating the church overlooking the spacious, well-lit and green Piazza San Cosimo. A few hundred metres from the Piazza, you can continue your cultural tour by visiting the Basilica di Nostra Signora di Bonaria, or entering the sumptuous and ghostly open-air art gallery that is the monumental cemetery, next to the hill where Sardinia's Christian temple par excellence is located.\n"}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Basilica di San Saturnino", "description": "The oldest church in

A sumptuous and ghostly art gallery outdoors. The streets of chapels and headstones in the cemetery occupy the Bonaria hill with funerary architecture and sculptures, works by the most popular artists who were active in Cagliari from half 19th century to the early 20th century. They reflect the taste of noble and high bourgeois families of the time, who rivalled against each other in their displays of wealth and power through funeral monuments.\nUp until Napoleon's decree that forbid burials in sacred places and in the centre of the city, in Cagliari the dead were buried in or near churches, with tragic consequences, including an epidemic of cholera in 1816. The cemetery was made at the foot of the hill, then in the periphery of the town, and had already been used as burial site during the Punic-Roman and paleo Christian eras.\nIt was built by Napoleon and consecrated in 1828. Various enlargements took it all the way to the top of the hill. It lost its function in 1968, and since then it has crystallised: no more suffering, but serenity, families without descendants, and oblivion.\nCypresses, hibiscus, palms, pine trees and roses embrace statues and chapels, made in various and harmonised styles: baroque, Art Nouveau, neoclassic, symbolistic, ancient and military signs, as in Viale degli Eroi, for those who died in the wars. Medallions, torches, stems, obelisks, sculptures of all kinds, bas- and alt-relief decorate the tombs. Epigraphs and inscriptions complete them.\nYou will feel the call of the souls as you walk along the boulevards. Uphill lie the young ones: sisters holding each other in an embrace and little brothers taken away by an angel, little Efisino sitting on his epitaph, Mary leaning on a balustrade as she peeks at the visitors. Pride and tragedies: Amina, the youngest of two sisters, died at 17 (1884) as a celebrity: the first Sardinian woman to obtain a middle school diploma in a public school. At a time when only boys were encouraged to study, it was quite an accomplished, but her sister Jenny also studied, but committed suicide two years later. Higher up, ossuaries and burial recesses. Many works were signed by the so-called Michelangelo of the dead, Giuseppe Sartorio. For instance, the sculpture of attorney Todde: in the foreground is his wife, with a scarf falling over her dress, masterfully sculpted. During her 25 years as a widow, Luigia saw herself smugly in that sculpture. At the top, noble and bourgeois memories were intertwined: merchants, entrepreneurs, artists and intellectuals who put a sheen on Cagliari. Not far from the cemetery lie two basilicas worth visiting: Sardinia's Christian temple par excellence, Nostra Signora di Bonaria, and the island's oldest paleo Christian sanctuary, the basilica of San Saturnino, the patron saint of the city.\n\n\n\n\n"}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Cemetery of Bonaria", "description": "A sumptuous and ghostly art gallery outdoors, with funerary architecture

Bonaria; . The white facade overlooks a bright square, while infinite stairs descend from the hilltop nearly all the way to the sea at suSiccu, one of Cagliari's marinas. After centuries of rebuilding and renovations, Nostra Signora di Bonaria, along with the 14th century sanctuary to the left of the church, is today the island's Christian temple par excellence. Legend has it that in 1370, in the middle of a storm, a ship jettisoned her load. The storm calmed as soon as a large case was thrown overboard, before floating to the shore in front of Bonaria hill. Inside was a wooden statue of the Madonna with a child in her arms and a candle in her hand, which remained miraculously alight. The whole of Sardinia was soon worshipping the statue, which is now kept in the altar of the small sanctuary, an early Sardinian example of Gothic-Catalan architecture built by Alfonso d'Aragona (1324) during the Pisan siege and donated to the Mercedarians. The monks built their convent, still inhabited today, next to the church.\nAn arch joins the small sanctuary to the majestic basilica, begun when the Mercedarians decided to construct a larger church in honour of the Virgin. The first stone was laid in 1704. After a long construction project, it was consecrated and named as a Basilica by Pius the 9th in 1926. It was damaged during the war, repaired, and most recently restored in the late 20th century. The well-lit interior is in the form of a Latin cross, with three naves separated by arcades and a wide transept. The cross point of the naves is topped by a dome. On the altar, you will find a reproduction of the legendary statue. Paintings, statues, reliefs and a rare pipe organ fill the ten chapels and transept.\nThe facade and the square reproduce the emblem of the order of Mercedes.To the sides of the square are bronze monuments: a ship fighting the winds and the Madonna watching over it. In the atrium, you can also see the sculpture of Pope Paul the 6th, who visited the basilica in 1970. He was followed by Saint John Paul the 2nd (1985), Benedict the 16th (2008) and Argentinian Pope Francis the 1st (2013), marking the links between Cagliari and Buenos Aires, named by the Spanish conquistadores precisely in honour of the Virgin of Bonaria. The convent is home to a museum with three rooms containing votive offerings by sailors, gifts from sovereigns, prelates and illustrious figures such as model ships, golden crowns, goblets and precious relics, including a silver anchor offered by Margherita di Savoia. These are accompanied by sabres, coins, porcelain and even sounding leads and bombs. Next to the basilica is the monumental cemetery, a sumptuous open-air art gallery, only a short walk from the island's oldest paleo-Christian sanctuary, the Basilica di San Saturnino."}, "entities":

One of the oldest and largest green lungs of Cagliari is home to a variety of picturesque local characters and historically significant buildings. Mount Urpinu park spreads out over 22 hectares on its eponymous hill between the Molentargius-Saline natural park and the Bonaria hills. It owes its name to a now-extinct colony of foxes that populated it until a few centuries ago, when it was still covered in wild vegetation. In fact, Urpinu means \"little fox\" in Campidanese. Monte Urpinu was also the site of some small military forts until it was bought by the aristocratic Sanjust family. The new owners first had it reforested, planting numerous Aleppo pines, and then restored a small church, now known as the Aragonese Church, originally built between the 17th and 18th centuries over the remains of a small Byzantine sanctuary.\nIn 1939, Monte Urpinu became the permanent property of the City of Cagliari. It was soon turned into an urban park, although the side that looks out over the Molentargius swamp remained at the disposal of the Italian air force, who constructed a base and some underground fuel storage tanks there. Another area of the hill was used as a limestone quarry. In 2007, the military abandoned its base, and several decades before that the park underwent a further reforestation project.\nIt is now one of the favourite outdoor leisure spots of local residents. Here you can walk along a series of paths or go for a good run. There is also exercise machinery and a popular tennis club. Families take their children to the park to enjoy the spacious equipped playground. Picnics can be organised in the shade of trees and next to some artificial lakes. There are even two hectares dedicated entirely to dogs. And speaking of animals, the local fauna is also one of the park's attractions. There are swans, moorhens, mallards, geese, tree frogs, turtles and colourful peacocks. The park is also home to a colony of cats. Equally interesting is the flora: in addition to the pines, you will spot willow trees, oleanders, junipers, and holm oak, mastic and olive trees.\nThe eastern flank of the hill has a panoramic road from which you can enjoy gorgeous views on both sides: from the Belvedere you'll see the spectacular Golfo degli Angeli (Gulf of Angels), spot the Sella del Diavolo (Devil's Saddle), Molentargius and its salt flats, and the Poetto beach. On the other side, looking west, you'll see San Michele hill, crowned with its medieval castle, the historical districts of Villanova, Castello and Marina, the harbour and the Stagno di Cagliari (Cagliari Pond)."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Monte Urpinu", "description": "A park in Cagliari with historical significance and a variety of flora and fauna.", "types": ["park", "urban park", "leisure spot", "green area", "natural park", "hill", "military fort", "limestone quarry", "panoramic road", "Belvedere", "playground", "lake", "exercise machinery", "tennis club", "dog area", "swans", "moorhens", "mallards", "geese", "tree frogs", "turtles", "peacocks", "cats", "pines", "willow trees", "oleanders", "junipers", "holm oak", "mastic trees", "olive trees", "Gulf of Angels", "Devil's Saddle", "Molentargius", "salt flats", "Poetto beach", "San Michele hill", "medieval castle", "Villanova", "Castello", "Marina", "harbour", "Cagliari Pond"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true, true, true, true, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]}}], "annotation": {"gpt missed": []}}, "triples": {"gpt": []}}, {"doc": {"id": 23, "uri": "https://www.sardegnaturismo.it/en/explore/cemetery-bonaria", "title": "Cemetery of Bonaria", "text": "The cloister of San Domenico; . The slow, pensive pace of the friars and the ancient and captivating liturgical chants move and resound in its shaded corridors. The cloister of San Domenico is a perfect model of medieval architecture in Cagliari: right in the centre, in the district of Villanova, at the foot of Castello. It embodies the spirit of the district, anchored in the religious tradition that comes to life every Lent in the Processioni dei Misteri (Processions of the Mysteries). The convent was built at the expense of the monarchs of Aragon and, in 1533, Charles V granted it the name of \"regio\" (royal). The cloister and adjacent crypt represent what has survived of the monumental complex, which was destroyed by bombing in 1943. The reconstruction during the Post-war period maintained the original structures as a crypt beneath the new building and very little of the ancient church was saved.\nThe floor plan of the cloister is square and measures 25 metres on each side: two original wings have been maintained - one from the 15th century and the other from the 16th century. The eastern and northern wings are the result of the rebuilding ordered by Phillip II of Spain in 1598. In the west wing, there are seven fourteenth century cross-vaulted chapels in Gothic Catalan style, resting on capitals sculpted with plant-inspired designs and animal figures. Once past the door and the steps, you will see two white vaults above you. The entire perimeter opens onto a garden with rounded arches, adorned with succulent plants. You can sit on a step and observe the meditating friars passing by, watch a function or one of the concerts that are often held in the crypt, which is sometimes also a location for photographic exhibitions and shows. Otherwise, you can simply walk along the corridors, in an atmosphere of worship and mysticism, before going back to discovering Cagliari and devoting your afternoon to some shopping in the town centre. From Via Manno, you can continue on through the historical districts: from the unique Bastion of Santa Croce to the Torri dell'Elefante and that of San Pancrazio, to the monuments of Stampace. From the Bastion of Saint Remy to the elegant shopping streets and the other buildings of worship in Villanova, like the churches of Sant'Anna and Sant'Antonio, to the distinctive streets full of typical restaurants and shops of the Marina, overlooking the harbour with the splendid palaces of Via Roma, among which the Palazzo Civico (Municipal building). Otherwise, you can move in the direction of the hill of Bonaria, visiting the Basilicas of San Saturnino, the most ancient in Sardinia, and Nostra Signora di Bonaria, the Christian temple of the Island and, next to it, the monumental cemetery.\n"}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Cloister of San Domenico", "description": "A medieval architectural complex in Cagliari, consisting of a square

The walls embrace a large garden where nature, history, culture and wellness reign. Monte Claro park sits on the summit of the eponymous hill, in the centre of Cagliari, a short distance from another of the seven hills on which the capital was built, San Michele hill. This park spreads out over 25 hectares delineated by walls that once encircled an old psychiatric hospital. In the late 19th century, the Province of Cagliari rented the area to house the unwell, and over time it became the pavilions of the hospital. All around were orchards, vineyards and crop fields where sometimes even the patients worked. The hospital was shut down in 1998 and the entire area was repurposed as a city park, opening in 2001. The main building, Villa Clara, where the hospital's director once lived, is now the metropolitan library.\nWhen you enter from the main gate, you'll walk over a road lined by oak trees, alongside which are some of the stone \"sound\" sculptures done by the artist Pinuccio Sciola. If you rub one with your hand or a small stone, it makes pleasant sounds. The road winds past a picturesque pond home to water turtles, swans, geese and ducks. As you continue, you'll come across the 'fontana logo', a pond equipped with technology that stages a fantastic series of jets of water. The symbol of the park is next to it: a stylised twig. The logo echoes a decoration from a bowl found in a tomb discovered in 1905. Monte Claro is, in fact, an archaeologically important area: the culture of Monte Claro gets its name from the traces of a pre-Nuragic settlement discovered here. The park is also home to the remains of a building that may have been used as a sacred well and, not far away, a mysterious 4th century BCE tomb where various amphora and the bones of a couple, buried in an embrace, were found. The mystery thickens, as this was the only Punic Age tomb discovered on the hill from an era when the vast, nearby necropolis of Tuvixeddu was still in use.\nAside from the historical and archaeological aspects, Monte Claro will surprise you for the richness of the vegetation that thrives here: carob, mastic, oleander, olive, pine, oak and willow trees, as well as mulberries, roses and hibiscus bushes.

Cagliari is built on seven hills and it is thought that the Romans worshipped the god Aesculapius atop the Colle di San Michele. In the Byzantine era, the pagan worship for the protector of medicine was replaced by the Christian worship for San Michele. Perhaps it is no coincidence that on the top of the hill, which can be reached from hairpin bends rising up between white tuffaceous rocks and the green of agaves and Mediterranean greenery, it appears there was once a monastery and, later, a church dedicated to the archangel. Rising up today, in excellent condition, is a medieval castle that overlooks the city, surrounded by a green park. Once isolated, today it is part of the is Mirrionis district. A 360-degree view of the capital can be enjoyed from the top, with the Pisan towers of the Castello district, the port, the Poetto, the Sella del Diavolo and the Santa Gilla lagoon. The manor, having long been the sentinel of the access road from Campidano, can be seen from all points around the town and the surrounds, even from kilometres away.\nThe quadrangular structure of the castle, built of limestone from the Cave of Bonaria, has three large corner towers, two older, to the north-east and south-east, constructed with perfectly squared ashlars, and a south-west tower that was erected later with a coarser technique, rising up even higher and without a talus wall base like the first two. They are connected by curtain walls. In the west, traces of the Romanesque facade of the Oratorio di San Michele Arcangelo can be seen. It has two entrances side-by-side, an indication of a building with two naves that became the castle's chapel, after having been incorporated therein. Around it is a wide and deep moat that can be crossed by a bridge, today as in the past, perhaps as early as the Piedmontese operations undertaken in the 18th century, which transformed the ancient manor into a modern fort.\nThe origins are controversial. One evocative theory places the birth between the end of the Byzantine age and the beginning of the time of the Judicatures (10th century) - a single tower to defend what was then the capital, Santa Igia. The structure would then be completed under the Pisans. More likely, the foundation is from the 12th century (from the Giudicati or Pisans), then reinforced in the 13th century with the addition of the two eastern towers. The third tower and other additions would then be Aragonese, starting in 1325, when Berengario Carroz, longa manus of the emperor Alfonso, received the San Michele hill in fief. In a few years, he transformed it into a fortress and a luxurious residence, adorned with precious objects (perhaps) plundered from the Basilica di San Saturno. Throughout the 14th century, the Castello di Bonvehi - so renamed at the time for its splendid view - benefited greatly from the various sovereigns. The Cagliari authorities contested the operations and abuse of the privileges granted by the Crown. The issue was resolved upon the granting of extradition to those who had enjoyed the protectorate of the Carroz. The events of Bonvehi remained inextricably linked to the noble Spanish family of the Carroz until 1511, following a century and a half of splendour. The last member of the family to live as the lord of the castle was Countess Violante, greatly feared and cursed by the clergy for the murder of a priest. During her time, the castle was also referred to as 'della Contessa' (the 'Countess's castle'). Apparently, her ghost still wanders about the fortress. In addition to ghosts, there are also various underground tunnels and treasures - there is evidence of an accusatory procedure (18th century) against a priest found guilty of having sought a treasure hidden in the castle through the ritual of 'afromanzia' or 'idromanzia' (hydromancy), being the invocation of the devil and recitation of magical spells. After the Carroz era, the castle was abandoned for over a century, before being used as a lazaret during the 'Plague of Sant'Efisio' (1652-56). Military functions resumed at the end of the 18th century, with the last moment of glory being in 1793 when, equipped with cannons, it defended the city from the invasion of Napoleon's militia. In 1867, it was sold to the Marquis Roberti di San Tommaso, who had it restored by Dionigi Scano and began the reforestation of the hill with Aleppo pines. From 1929 to 1972, it was the Navy's radio-telegraphic station. The restoration and enhancement works of the late-20th century transformed the fortress into a modern art and culture centre, with the hill becoming a site of scenic value.\n\n"}, "entities": {"gpt":

The name comes from tuvu and means 'little hole'. It is easy to see why: you will be amazed by a myriad of tunnels in the limestone rocks that cover most of the 18 hectares of Tuvixeddu, which together with Tuvumannu - separated by an artificial canyon - is one of the seven hills of Cagliari. The Carthaginians decided to bury their dead here, creating the largest existing Punic necropolis comprised of around a thousand 'well' tombs, used from the 6th to 3rd centuries BC and then reused in Roman times. The hill reveals a continuity of use that starts, in reality, from the ancient Neolithic, as documented by flint and obsidian remnants dating from the 6th to 5th millennium BC.\nThe Punic necropolis served a large inhabited town that extended from the foot of the hill - now the Sant'Avendrace district - to the eastern shore of the Laguna di Santa Gilla. Remain from the 'city of the living', moving eastwards, are walls with a 'shell' structure and floors where the goddess Tanit appears, the main deity for the Carthaginians. The tophet, the children's cemetery, was perhaps also located in the same area. In the upper part of Tuvixeddu, thanks to footbridges, one can observe the sepulchral chambers - one or more for each sepulchre - located at the base. These were reachable through vertical wells, three to eleven metres deep, equipped with lateral grooves (footholds) to facilitate descent. The entryway was closed by stone slabs and covered with earth to protect the deceased buried within and the rich grave goods. Placed within were amulets and jewels (gold and silver pendants, necklaces and beetles), decorated ceramic vases and amphorae, ampoules where perfumed essences ('lacrimatoi'), weapons, cups, oil lamps, painted ostrich eggs, masks, coins, razors, statuettes, the likeness of the god Bes, and bronze tools found in the excavation works are now on display at the National Archaeological Museum in Cagliari. The funerary chambers, in some cases, are finely adorned. The wall paintings, dating from the 4th-3rd centuries BC and almost unique in the Punic world, depict floral elements, such as friezes of lotus flowers and palmettes, gorgons, geometric motifs and red ochre. Standouts include the Tomba del Sid, where the Sardinian-Punic divinity is represented, also present in the Tempio di Antas (in Fluminimaggiore); the Tomba dell'Ureo, embellished by a pictorial frieze with the main figure being the snake Ureo, a winged cobra sacred to the Egyptian religion; and the Tomba del Combattente (the Fighter's Tomb) with a representation of a warrior hurling a spear. In many others, the goddess Tanit appears. In the Roman Republic and Imperial ages, the necropolis was further enlarged on the slopes overlooking Viale Sant'Avendrace, with tombs characterised by a rich decorative sculptural and painted heritage. The Roman necropolis is composed of tombs, often frescoed, of various types: pit, chamber, incineration, arcosolium (typical of the catacombs), dovecotes and monumental tombs, including the sepulchre of Atilia Pomptilla, built in the 2nd century AD by Lucio Cassio Filippo in honour of his wife. In the decoration are two snakes, the symbol of the genius of Cassio Filippo, from which derives the common name, Grotta della Vipera.\nThe hill fell victim to much destruction and looting, since 140 AD, when the Roman workers dug a long stretch of aqueduct here, still visible today. Even then, the hill was used as a quarry. After the destruction of the city of Santa Igia in the second half of the 13th century, a number of survivors settled on the slopes of the hill, exploiting the tombs as dwellings. During the bombings of the Second World War, the tombs were again used as air-raid shelters and, following the conflict, became the home of displaced and homeless people. More recently, the urbanisation of the neighbourhood and especially the mining activities have caused the destruction of numerous Punic and Roman tombs. Until the 1980s, the hill was a quarry for cement works. The tunnels excavated revealed Roman aqueducts and countless Carthaginian tombs, many of which had been plundered by grave robbers, whilst others had been destroyed by exploding mines. The bourgeois villas that surround the hill, such as the Art Nouveau mansion of Villa Mulas, bear witness to the residential use of the hill in the 20th century. In 1997, the necropolis was opened to the public for the first time on the occasion of the first edition of Monumenti Aperti (Open Monuments).

It is small, perched on a rocky outcrop, and only accessible from one side, but perfectly placed visually, compared to the other coastal towers of the Golfo degli Angeli. The only function the Tower of Prezzemolo could have had was as a watchtower, yet it has a long and glorious history, during which its name was often changed. In the official documents, it is identified as the tower of Cape Bernat - from the name of the rocky outcrop on which it stands -, the tower of Safa, from Santo Stefano del Lazzaretto, Torre Vecchia (Old Tower) and the tower of Prajola. For the Spaniards, who built it after the first half of the 16th century, it was the torrezilla, meaning 'the small tower'. Today, quite ironically, almost by the law of retaliation, it steals its name from another building that no longer exists and that was located in the nearby cape of Cala Fighera.\nThe little tower was part of a of coastal fortification complex built between the hills of Sant'Elia and San Bartolomeo during the sixteenth century, to protect Cagliari from the incursions of pirates and Muslim corsairs. In particular, the Tower of Prezzemolo watched over the beach below, the area of the Lazaret and the nearby salt pans. Already towards the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th century, it was renovated and, when the nearby Tower of Calamosca became fully operational, it was abandoned and disappeared from official documents until 1772. It was then rearmed as a station for riflemen and to support a light infantry company. However, its greatest moment of glory dates back to 1793, when it warded off a French raid, with the aid of a battery of cannons, preventing them from landing on the beach. The ships, which were also hindered by the northwesterly wind, were then permanently pushed away to the west, near the Foxi Tower. After that, the tower was abandoned, never to be operational again, and was not renovated until 1916, while the rock it stands upon was reinforced in the second half of the 20th century to prevent it from crumbling.\nThe construction is shaped like a truncated cone, currently 11 metres high and with a diameter of four and a half metres. When it was active, it only accommodated two tower keepers. An open hatch in the dome allowed access to the outdoor terrace, originally covered by a 'crescent' or semi-circular roof made of reeds and tiles. The only opening is the entrance, built with abutments and a stone architrave.\nFrom its summit, 45 metres above the sea, it was possible to see as far as 23 kilometres away. Not surprisingly, it is now an evocative panoramic viewpoint, especially at sunset, when the scenery on the western side of the Golfo degli Angeli will leave you breathless. From the tower, you can go on foot or by bike to two other military constructions on the hill: the C-135 anti-aircraft battery, from the 1930s, and the Forte di Sant'Elia, known as the Fortino di Sant'Ignazio, dating back to the end of the 18th century."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Tower of Prezzemolo", "description": "A small tower built as a watchtower to protect Cagliari from pirates

Set in a splendid bay overlooked and sheltered, almost protected, by two impressive promontories: to the east is Capo Sant'Elia, dominated by an ancient lighthouse, to the west is the fascinating Sella del Diavolo (Devil's Saddle), named for its peculiar shape which legend has it was the place where Lucifer landed when he was thrown out of heaven. Calamosca beach, only four kilometres from the centre of Cagliari, is located along the long, wide coastline of Poetto. Its transparent waters gleam with emerald and azure tones, while the sandy beach and smooth pebbles gently slopes to the sea, making it perfect for children and particularly popular with underwater fishing and diving enthusiasts. There is plenty of parking space, a bar-kiosque and beach equipment to hire.\nA small path leads from the beach up to a panoramic viewpoint over the Golfo degli Angeli. You'll need to climb up to the promontory to the foot of the Calamosca watchtower, built by the Spanish in the 17th century. We recommend taking hiking shoes and equipment and following the path to the left of the cliffs, towards the Sella del Diavolo: along the way, you can admire numerous small coves before arriving in another miniature paradise with a rocky seabed, Cala Fighera.

Its unmistakable profile is one of Cagliari's most characteristic features, leaving an impression due to its particular shape and dominant position on the Poetto beach. The Sella del Diavolo (Devil's Saddle) occupies the exact centre of the Golfo degli Angeli (Gulf of Angels) and is the offshoot of the Sant'Elia hill that reaches out to the sea. For decades now, the promontory has been a favourite destination for trips just a stone's throw from the city centre, ideal for hiking, even at night, with surprising traces of human habitation that have alternated over millennia, and an irresistible attraction for the view from its summit. The scenery is so impressive that, according to legend, even heavenly and demonic hosts fought over it. The myth is told in two slightly different versions, particularly in terms of the reason for the 'heavenly battle'.\nAccording to the most popular version, the devils were enthralled by the place and tried to take possession of it. According to the variant, however, it was the angels who asked God for this enchantment, chosen for its purity and absence of evil, as a gift, triggering Lucifer's jealousy. The battle took place in the skies above the coast of Cagliari and saw the victory of the army of angels led by the archangel Michael. During the battle, Lucifer lost his saddle, which fell and turned into rock, giving rise to the promontory. This gave rise to the name Sella del Diavolo (The Devil's Saddle) and also the name Golfo degli Angeli (Gulf of Angels), as the inhabitants of the large inlet wanted to name it after their saviours.\nPaths branch off from the square next to the small beach of Calamosca or from the small port of Marina Piccola, allowing you to explore the promontory, offering unmissable views of the landscape, up to, on clear days, Capo Carbonara, including the view of the twelve kilometres of Poetto and its promenade and, behind them, the profile of the Molentargius-Saline Park. Along the way you will notice European fan palms, junipers and wild olive trees, as well as mastic trees and euphorbias. The promontory also offers shelter to rare birds, such as peregrine falcons, kestrels and Sardinian partridges. It is also not uncommon for foxes and wild rabbits to appear in the bushes.\nThe natural cavities around Capo Sant'Elia have yielded traces of habitation since the Neolithic period. On the highest point are the ruins of a Punic temple dedicated to Astarte, as testified by the discovery of a slab preserved in the Archaeological Museum of Cagliari. You will also see two cisterns, one of Punic origin, larger than the second from Roman times. A perimeter of foundations leads back to the former church of Sant'Elia, most likely built in the 11th century by the Vittorini monks together with their monastery. According to tradition, the saint was martyred on the hill. The watchtower, part of the coastal defence system against Saracen raids, is of Spanish origin. In Catalan it was called pouhet ('little well') and the name Poetto is thought to derive from this. Finally, some military structures, including a blockhouse that you will encounter along the way, date back to the Second World War.\n\n"}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Sella del Diavolo", "description": "A promontory located in Cagliari, Sardinia, with a legendary story behind its name.", "types": ["Landform", "Tourist attraction"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [false, true]}}, {"label": "Golfo degli Angeli", "description": "A large inlet in Cagliari, Sardinia, named after the angels who won the battle against Lucifer over the Sella del Diavolo.", "types": ["Geographic feature"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [false]}}, {"label": "Sant'Elia hill", "description": "A hill in Cagliari, Sardinia, from which the Sella del Diavolo promontory extends out to the sea.", "types": ["Landform"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [false]}}, {"label": "Archangel Michael", "description": "The leader of the army of angels who won the battle against Lucifer over the Sella del Diavolo, according to legend.", "types": ["Religious figure"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Neolithic period", "description": "A period of prehistory that dates back to around 10,000 BC and during which traces of habitation have been found around Capo Sant'Elia.", "types": ["Historical period"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Punic temple", "description": "A temple dedicated to Astarte, a Phoenician goddess, located on the highest point of the Sella del Diavolo promontory.", "types": ["Religious site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Vittorini monks", "description": "A group of monks who most likely built the former church of Sant'Elia on the Sella del Diavolo promontory in the 11th century.", "types": ["Religious group"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Watchtower", "description": "A tower of Spanish origin located on the Sella del Diavolo promontory, part of the coastal defence system against Saracen raids.", "types": ["Historical site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Blockhouse", "description": "A military structure located on the Sella del Diavolo promontory, dating back to the Second World War.", "types": ["Historical site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}], "annotation": {"gpt missed": []}}, "triples": {"gpt": [{"subject label": "Golfo degli Angeli", "predicate label": "named after", "predicate description": "expresses a relationship between two entities where one is given a name based on the other.

Since the beginning of the 20th century, the inhabitants of Cagliari favoured the western part of the Golfo degli Angeli. Then, little by little, as they began to appreciate the white dunes, the first establishments, a kiosk and a summer camp were created and, lastly, the famous multicoloured bathing huts were built (and then completely removed in 1986). Over time, the area has become increasingly populated, earning it the name of 'Spiaggia dei Centomila' (beach of a hundred thousand). Today, the Poetto is the undisputed 'sea' of Cagliari's hinterland, one of the largest city beaches in Europe, as well as the most beautiful and frequented island, a favourite destination for those visiting the capital in summer or any sunny day throughout the year, also being a perfect stop to enjoy a coffee or aperitif accompanied by the sea breeze.\nA few kilometres from the centre and port of Cagliari, the beach extends from the secluded and relaxing Margine Rosso on the Quartu Sant'Elena coast, through to the Sella del Diavolo, which embellishes the charm of looking down over Marina Piccola - offering the chance to savour a walk along the marina. From the Spanish tower atop, called \"del poeta\", perhaps derives the name of the coastline, even if the most likely hypothesis is that it comes from the Spanish 'puerto' (port). You can climb up to the 17th-century tower along the promontory from Calamosca, with the route taking around an hour and being utterly beautiful by night. On the opposite coast of the 'Sella' hides the delightful and sheltered beaches of Calamosca and Cala Fighera.\nThe entire stretch of the Poetto beach is broad, whilst the water is clear and the seabed sandy and shallow for tens of metres, being ideal for children to play. The shore is irresistible for taking long walks. You can travel along the pathway that runs behind the modern waterfront - perfect for walking, jogging, biking, skating, rollerblading and skateboarding - whilst the characteristic kiosks near the sand offer refreshments and entertainment. Bathrooms and showers are available, with there also being some spaces reserved for dogs. Reaching the area from the city is easy, with the services being quite efficient and including bathing establishments, diving centres, sailing schools, boat rentals, beach tennis and volleyball courts, canoe rides, fast food and restaurants, along with shops and an amusement park that is open all-year-round. The lido offers an excellent beach break for surfing and kitesurfing, where world-class events are hosted, along with great nightlife in one of the main sites for summer by night in the vast area in which live music and dance lessons, bars and clubs are to be found.\nThe extension of the beach is evenly divided along the four kilometres or so of the Quartu coast and the four forming part of Cagliari, split according to the stops of the tram that has since been replaced by buses in more recent times. The 'first stop' has a very shallow seabed, the 'second' and 'third' are the place in which the historic establishments of D'Aquila and Lido are located, the law enforcement agencies are at the 'fourth' stop, while from the 'fifth', where the Spanish tower stands, to the end of the line, there is a vast stretch of 'free' beach. The border with the coastline of Quartu is La Bussola, the name of which comes from an establishment that is no longer in operation. From here, the free beach alternates with welcoming and well-equipped beach establishments.\nFrom the beach, you can quickly reach the 'vie del sale' ('salt streets') that slightly extend the walk to the Molentargius-Saline park that has an entrance on the seafront. You will be spoilt for choice when it comes to choosing an excursion in the protected area - guided and free tours by bike and on foot, boat routes along the canals of the former salt marshes, electric buses. You are sure to enjoy a unique experience with a mix of historical and scientific knowledge through one of the most beautiful and important natural sites of the island, an oasis just a short distance from the city and a favourite abode for the pink flamingos that stop to nest here. Poetto and Molentargius are also closely linked by the activities of the salt mill that commenced in Roman times and ceased only in 1985."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Poetto", "description": "A

A place in equilibrium between mankind and the environment, between bodies of water and vestiges of ancient salt basins for some 400,000 citizens. Within the vast area of Cagliari, it is an oasis for leisure just a short distance from home and for its most famous inhabitants - the pink flamingos - that find the perfect nesting place right here. Without disturbing them, you can admire these majestic birds in Molentargius, which was the richest Sardinian basin for sea-salt extraction for two and a half centuries - an activity that ceased in 1985 - as evidenced by the name itself, deriving from molenti (donkey), an ancient means of transporting the precious loads of salt. Already included in the 1977 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, the area became a regional park in 1999 to protect and enhance one of the main resting and nesting sites of aquatic birds in Europe. The Molentargius-Saline extends across 1,600 hectares in the extreme southern part of the Campidano plain, overlooking the Golfo degli Angeli (Gulf of the Angels) and bordered by Cagliari urbanisation of Quartu Sant'Elena, Quartucciu and Selargius, and by the seafront of the beautiful Poetto. Its uniqueness can be perceived even from the peaks of Monte Urpinu and Sella del Diavolo.\nThe protected territory is divided into two systems, fresh and salt water: a coexistence sui generis. The fresh-water ponds are the Perdalonga, the Bellarosa Minore and the 'filter ecosystem', a natural purification system that separates the Bellarosa Minore from the salt waters of Bellarosa Maggiore (or, Molentargius), utilised throughout the salt production activities as the first evaporation tank. The other salt areas are the Perdabianca pond, the former salt basins of Cagliari and the Quartu pond that respectively housed the second and third evaporation and crystallisation tank for sodium chloride. Separating the two systems emerges the \"fossil\" plain of is Arenas, cultivated up until the mid-20th century. The fresh-water environments are characterised by expanses of reeds and bulrush, as well as hydrophilic vegetation; where there is high salinity, you will find halophyte, glasswort, endemic and rare species inscribed in the Red List of Threatened Species.\nVisiting the park, you will be spoilt for choice - guided tours on foot, by bike or by boat along the canals and on electric buses, together with the operators of the Centre for Environmental Education and Sustainability (CEAS). You will be accompanied to the areas that are best suited to birdwatching, stopping in a hut before the embankment of Bellarosa Maggiore, where the flamingo and slender-billed gull nest. Even the reed of the Minore is a refuge for nesting birds, including the cattle egret, the black-winged stilt, little egret, mallard and numerous species of ducks. With a little luck, you will see the shy sultan chicken, with its metallic blue plumage and scarlet red beak. The free pathways within the green areas offer daily access - just be sure to bring your binoculars with you, so as not to disturb the birdlife from up close. There is even a bikesharing station and rental service available for the bike tours.\nThe Molentargius landscape is the product of a long industrial process, linked to the centuries-old history of the salt basins. The park is dotted with architecture from various eras - 19th-century canals and basins, the workers' village and iron bridges from the early-20th century, the sheds of the \"salt channels\", sluice gates and battlements, the Decauville railway and the Rollone pumping station. The Phoenicians, Punics and Romans were the first exporters of Sardinian salt. Under the Judicatures, the salt basins acquired international importance, before then being used by the Pisans, Aragonese, Spanish and Piedmontese. Industrial production began in 1830. A new impetus came in 1920s and 1930s, with modern facilities comprising the \"city of salt\", being an integrated complex of workplaces and residences, similar to contemporary mining villages. There is also the management building, the 'select salt' edifice (now home to the park) and the former recreational building including an auditorium that is today the Teatro delle Saline. There are also the laboratories, warehouses, workshops, the joinery, cafeteria and change rooms. The industrial settlement is flanked by military ruins and the anti-tank obstacles from the Second World War of su Staineddu.\n\n\n\n"}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "The Park of Molentargius-Saline", "description": "A regional park protecting and enhancing one of the main resting and nesting sites of aquatic birds in Europe.", "types": ["Protected area", "Regional park", "Wetland", "Salt basin", "Tourist attraction"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true, true, true]}}, {"label": "Pink flamingos", "description": "Majestic birds that find the perfect nesting place in Molentargius.", "types": ["Bird species", "Aquatic bird"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Molentargius", "description": "The richest Sardinian basin for sea-salt extraction for two and a half centuries.", "types": ["Salt basin", "Industrial heritage"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [false, true]}}, {"label": "Ramsar Convention", "description": "A convention on Wetlands of International Importance that included Molentargius in 1977.", "types": ["Convention", "Wetland protection"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Industrial heritage", "description": "Architecture from various eras that dot the park, linked to the centuries-old history of the salt basins.", "types": ["Industrial archaeology", "Architecture", "Salt production"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": false, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [false, false, false]}}, {"label": "Teatro delle Saline", "description": "An auditorium that was once a recreational building and is now part of the industrial heritage of Molentargius.", "types": ["Auditorium", "Industrial heritage"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}], "annotation": {"gpt missed": []}}, "triples": {"gpt": [{"subject label": "The Park of Molentargius-Saline", "predicate label": "protects and enhances", "predicate description": "Expresses the action of safeguarding and improving the conditions of something, in this case, the Molentargius area, which is a regional park and one of the main resting and nesting sites of aquatic birds in Europe.", "object label": "Molentargius", "annotation": {"triple correctness": false, "relation from text": false}}, {"subject label": "Pink flamingos", "predicate label": "nesting place in", "predicate description": "Expresses the location where the subject finds a suitable place to build a nest.", "object label": "The Park of Molentargius-Saline", "annotation": {"triple correctness": true, "relation from text": true}}, {"subject label": "Pink flamingos", "predicate label": "nesting place in", "predicate description": "Expresses the location where the subject finds a suitable place to build a nest.", "object label": "Molentargius", "annotation": {"triple correctness": true, "relation from text": true}}, {"subject label": "Ramsar Convention", "predicate label": "included", "predicate description": "Expresses that the object is part of or included in the subject.", "object label": "Molentargius", "annotation": {"triple correctness": false, "relation from text": false}}, {"subject label": "Teatro delle Saline", "predicate label": "part of", "predicate description": "Expresses a relationship between two entities where one is a constituent or a member of the other.

Monserrato lies in the southernmost part of the Campidano province, near the Molentargius-Saline Regional Park, within the metropolitan city of Cagliari. Monserrato is a city with 20,000 inhabitants, whose inhabited area, through the municipality of Pirri, is seamlessly joined with that of the capital, from which it became independent via a referendum in 1991. In Sardinian, it is known as Pauli (swamp), already the name in medieval times. It then became Pauli Pirri. In 1881, the name changed to Pauli Monserrato. Just seven years later, via royal decree, this became Monserrato, deriving from the Madonna of Montserrat.\nThe old town is characterised by narrow streets overlooked by typical Campidanese houses in Ladiri (mud-brick), with Spanish loggias and wooden portals. The winemaking tradition lives on, as is testified by Sagra della vendemmia (Grape Harvest Festival) at the end of September. Its communal winery is the oldest in Sardinia (1924), with nuragus, monica, moscato and nasco wines produced here. From the end of the 20th century, construction was remarkable, with new and modern neighbourhoods being built. Along the road to Sestu, the Cittadella Universitaria was built, being a vast complex connected to the city by the Ponte Strallato (bridge) on the state road 554, the only one on the island. Inside the citadel is the Museo Sardo di Antropologia ed Etnografia (Sardinian museum of anthropology and ethnography). The other main exhibition is the Museo delle Ferrovie della Sardegna, dedicated to the construction and operation of historic stations and railway lines, with an area in which old-time steam locomotives and vintage carriages are kept. There is also the Trenino Verde, a tourist service that departs from Monserrato and heads to Mandas and Isili.\nTo be admired in the heart of the city is the parish church of Sant'Ambrogio (whose patron saint is celebrated on 7th December), in late Gothic-Catalan architecture, built between the late-15th and early-16th centuries. Whilst there was originally one nave, today the interior has three, with the central one being wide and tall, composed of pillars that unite in ogival arches. The side aisles are barrel-covered with six chapels on each side. On the high altar in gilded wood and polychrome marble (1705), scenes of peasant life and Christian symbols are carved in bas relief. The baptismal font is the work of Catalan craftsmen of the 15th century. Particular and unique in Sardinia is the conformation of the diagonal buttresses of the facade. The earliest information on the Church of Santa Maria de Pauli dates back to the 12th century. Its Greek cross layout is surmounted by a 19th-century dome. It is only open in September to celebrate the Virgin of Montserrat, just prior to the harvest rituals. Within are housed works by artist Gianni Argiolas, including the 'Painting of the Procession'. Another illustrious local is painter Cesare Cabras (1886-1968), whose works are on display inside the town hall. A stand-out amongst the Monserrato traditions is the luxurious traditional women's clothing."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Monserrato", "description": "A city in the Campidano province with a

Giuliano; . Its sober and harmonious architecture is the theatre of sa promissa, an evocative ritual of the Antico Sposalizio Selargino (Historic Selargino Wedding): on parchment, the bride and groom handwrite a promise of love, which is kept for 25 years in a glass case. There is no documentary evidence on the foundation of the church of San Giuliano Ospitaliere, protector of travellers. One of the first Sardinian buildings in Romanesque-Victorian style, it certainly arose between the late-11th and early-12th century and was reworked in the 13th. According to tradition this was the first parish church of Selargius. It is located in the heart of the city in Cagliari's hinterland, a short distance from the current parish church of the Vergine Assunta, built in the 16th century, and the tower of the former Si 'e Boi distillery that is today a cultural park. Then there is the church of San Lussorio, another Romanesque architectural jewel, on the outskirts.\nSan Giuliano is a small treasure trove. Extending just 115 square metres, it is perhaps the smallest three-nave church in Sardinia. Its archaic charm captivates at first glance: it is enclosed in a courtyard with garden, which also includes Casa Collu, currently the custodian of an expansive and beautiful painting from 1785, originally created for the back wall of the church. The baroque canvas depicts the Virgin and Child surrounded by angels offering the rosary to Saints Giuliano and Domenico. Below are four brethren in a white habit and black cloak, typical of the confraternity of the Vergine del Rosario that, for over four centuries, guarded over the building and organised various celebrations: for the saint (9th January), for Purification, for the Vergine del Rosario and, on the second Sunday in September, for the Historic Wedding.\nOver the centuries, the church has been subject to additions and adaptations. During the restoration at the end of the 20th century, two medieval burials with funerary goods were discovered beneath the floor. Today, they are covered with thick sheets of glass. The stone facade is enriched by a bell gable and preceded by a three-arched porch, added between the 16th and 17th centuries and resting on Tuscan order columns, in reference to the lollas (loggias) of the Campidano houses. The propensity to reuse is characteristic of the church - even the 'chunky' columns of the interior, being recycled, are different from each other in materials (marble, granite and limestone) and compositional elements, reflecting the Romanesque taste for asymmetry and imprecise forms. The portal is at the centre of the facade, architraved and surmounted by a lunette, at the base of which are two protomes - an ox's head and a ram's head. On the south-western side, above, you will notice an ashlar depicting a three-legged man (trescambas), symbol of fecundity in Byzantine pagan rituals. The hall has three naves, marked by pillars, with wooden trussed roofing in the central nave and pitched roofing in the side aisles. The interior finishes with a semi-circular apse, marked externally with pilasters and arches. Amongst the treasures safeguarded within the temple, you will be captivated by the expressive sweetness of the Vergine de s'Incresciu (purification), a wooden simulacrum entirely carved then covered with fabrics and wearing a wig of real hair. Also to admire is the 16th-17th century crucifix, represented according to the Gothic 'Cristo Doloroso' tradition, the 19th century wooden statue of San Giuliano on horseback, in the guise of a Roman soldier, and the marble holy water font from 1664."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Chiesa di San Giuliano", "description": "A small Romanesque-Victorian style church in Selargius, Sardinia, with a

One of the few completely frescoed Sardinian churches, an architectural monument that is the result of nine centuries of reconstructions and restorations, the last complete one of which was in 1996-99. The parish church of Sant'Elena stands in the historic centre of Quartu Sant'Elena, elevated to the dignity of a minor basilica in 2007 by Pope Benedict XVI. Saint Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine the Great, is the patron saint of the third largest Sardinian city by inhabitants. In 1826, Quarto added its name to the official denomination, which eventually became Quartu Sant'Elena in 1862. The oldest cult building dedicated to the saint was built in the mid-12th century in Romanesque style, and large enough for the needs of Quarto domino, one of the villae from which the current city derived. Between the 15th and 16th centuries, a larger church in Sardinian-Catalan Gothic style was built. Next to the facade there was an octagonal bell-tower, the pride of the city at the time as it was unique in the district of Cagliari.\nAfter various renovations, the church was destroyed by fire in 1775 and reconstruction work ended in 1828. The restoration of the end of the 20th century gave it its current appearance: from the previous church remain the oratory of the Rosary, the bell-tower, the clock tower and two chapels. Today its neoclassical facade stands out in the square named for it, completed by a triangular tympanum and divided into two orders by a springcourse cornice: at the bottom there is a wooden portal, and a glazed window in the upper part. On the right side stands the liberty style tower with the clock, and on the left stands the octagonal bell-tower, tall, slender and domed. The single nave is barrel-vaulted. Three round arches divide the internal harmony into three bays. At the intersection, an airy octagonal dome rises. The presbytery floor is in precious marble, laid at the end of the 20th century, while the rest of the paving is 19th century. The vaults and walls are all frescoed with paintings made almost all in the years 1924-40. The frescoes depict the battle of Ponte Milvio, scenes from the life of Jesus and the Madonna, the Holy Family and St. Helena presenting her son Constantine to the Trinity. Among the sculptures in marble, don't miss a baroque-style pulpit, sculpted by Pietro Pozzo in 1741, an antependium that is the oldest item of furnishing (1684), the two white water stoups at the entrance and, above all, the main altar made with polychrome marbles in baroque style by Giovanni Battista Franco in 1818, modified and expanded in 1907 by Giuseppe Sartorio. Its niche houses the statue of the patron saint, which is carried in a procession during the festival in mid-September. On the right is the 17th century wooden crucifix, and behind is an 18th century wooden choir. There are six chapels, three on each side, all barrel-vaulted and intercommunicating. Those on the left are dedicated to the Assunta, who is depicted asleep (dormitio Virginis), to Saint Joseph and to the Blessed Sacrament, in an area remaining from the previous Gothic church. On the right, in addition to the 'baptism' chapel, are the chapels of Saint Gabriel, which houses a large canvas painted by Bacicia Scano - who did most of the frescoes - and of the Sacred Heart of Jesus with the oldest wooden altar in the church. In the transept are the chapels of the Rosary and the Holy Crucifix, whose altar holds a dying Jesus. Next to the transept there is a large sacristy, which preserves a walnut screen, a white marble washbasin and a 1732 fratino table."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Sant'Elena imperatrice", "description": "A church dedicated to Saint Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine the Great, located in Quartu Sant'Elena, Sardinia", "types": ["Church", "Basilica", "Historical monument"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true]}}, {"label": "Quartu Sant'Elena", "description": "A city in Sardinia, Italy, where the church of Sant'Elena imperatrice is located", "types": ["City", "Location"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Saint Helena", "description": "Patron saint of Quartu Sant'Elena and mother of the emperor Constantine the Great", "types": ["Saint", "Historical figure"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Romanesque style", "description": "An architectural style characterized by rounded arches, barrel vaults, and thick walls, typical of the mid-12th century church dedicated to Saint Helena in Quartu Sant'Elena", "types": ["Architectural style"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": false, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Sardinian-Catalan Gothic style", "description": "An architectural style characterized by pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and slender columns, typical of the larger church built between the 15th and 16th centuries in Quartu Sant'Elena", "types": ["Architectural style"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Neoclassical style", "description": "An architectural style characterized by simplicity, symmetry, and classical elements, typical of the facade of the church of Sant'Elena imperatrice after the restoration at the end of the 20th century", "types": ["Architectural style"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Pietro Pozzo", "description": "The sculptor who created the baroque-style pulpit in the church of Sant'Elena imperatrice in 1741", "types": ["Sculptor", "Artist"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Giovanni Battista Franco", "description": "The artist who created the main altar made with polychrome marbles in baroque style in the church of Sant'Elena imperatrice in 1818, modified and expanded in 1907 by Giuseppe Sartorio", "types": ["Artist", "Sculptor"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Giuseppe Sartorio", "description": "The artist who modified and expanded the main altar made with polychrome marbles in baroque style in the church of Sant'Elena imperatrice in 1907", "types": ["Artist", "Sculptor"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Bacicia Scano", "description": "The artist who painted most of the frescoes in the church of Sant'Elena imperatrice between 1924 and 1940", "types": ["Artist", "Painter"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}], "annotation": {"gpt missed": []}}, "triples": {"gpt": [{"subject label": "Sant'Elena imperatrice", "predicate label": "located in", "predicate description": "Expresses the location of an entity.", "object label": "Quartu Sant'Elena", "annotation": {"triple correctness": true, "relation from text": true}}, {"subject label": "Sant'Elena imperatrice", "predicate label": "dedicated to", "predicate description": "Expresses the dedication of an entity to another entity or concept.", "object label": "Saint Helena", "annotation": {"triple correctness": true, "relation from text": true}}, {"subject label": "Quartu Sant'Elena", "predicate label": "hasChurch", "predicate description": "Expresses the relationship between a location and a religious building that is present in that location.", "object label": "Sant'Elena imperatrice", "annotation": {"triple correctness": true, "relation from text": true}}, {"subject label": "Saint Helena", "predicate label": "patron saint of", "predicate description": null, "object label": "Quartu Sant'Elena", "annotation": {"triple correctness": false, "relation from text": false}}, {"subject label": "Quartu Sant'Elena", "predicate label": "has church", "predicate description": "Expresses the relationship between a location and a specific architectural style used in the construction of a church located in that location.

At the end of the 20th century, thanks to the construction of new districts, it underwent considerable expansion and its inhabitants doubled. Today, with over 70 thousand residents, Quartu Sant'Elena is the third largest town on the Island, after Cagliari and Sassari. Once an agricultural centre, today its wine-growing production is still alive and it is renowned for its Malvasia wine. Its jewellery made using gold filigree is also famous, as is its production of breads and homemade pastries: candelaus, pabassinas and piricchitus. Its territory is located between: the Campidano plain, the mountains and the woods of the Oasis of Sette Fratelli and the Molentargius-Saline park, which you can visit on foot or by bike and admire greater flamingo colonies. The Quartu coast starts from the shoreline of Poetto and stretches for tens of kilometres along the eastern part of the Golfo degli Angeli. There is a mixture of sheer cliffs and sandy or pebbly beaches: Capitana, with a tourist port and, behind it, hills covered in poplars and eucalyptus trees, the natural pools of Is Mortorius, Cala Regina with pebbles and a blue sea, the beautiful Is Canaleddus and the spectacular Mari Pintau, where smooth stones are bathed by the 'painted sea' with its dazzling colours. Lastly, there is Geremeas, with its soft, white beaches: Kala 'e Moru, Marongiu and Baccu Mandara.\nQuartu emerged from the union of three villages. In order to protect it from the Saracens, the Spanish built five towers along the coast. Among the churches, the basilica of Sant'Elena Imperatrice stands out, inside which there are still beautiful frescoes, a pulpit and a baptismal font dating back to the 18th century and a statue of the saint, which is carried in a procession during the celebration of the patron saint (mid-September). Other ancient buildings are Santa Maria di Cepola, built on Early Christian ruins and extended in the 14th century, and Sant'Agata, dating back to the 12th century and then rebuilt between 1280 and 1300. In the countryside, there is Nostra Signora del Buon Cammino, with columns from the Roman era. Further evidence of the Roman period is a villa in the district of Sant'Andrea, now submerged by the sea. In the territory, there are 38 Nuragic sites: the main one is Nuraghe Diana, with a main tower and two minor ones connected by curtain walls. In May, during a stage of the Monumenti Aperti (Open Monuments) event, you can visit historical buildings like the kilns that, between 1878 and 1985, produced bricks and roof tiles, the slaughterhouse, which was active until 1968, and the former Perra paper mill of 1911, which was the only factory producing paper for packaging. For the event, the ancient Campidano houses, with their frescoed ceilings and tiles with geometric patterns, are also opened up. There are two dwellings used as ethnographic museums: Sa Dom'e Farra (house of flour), in which agricultural tools are kept, and Il Ciclo della Vita (the cycle of life), where eight thousand traditional objects (18th-20th century) are on display. The Sciampitta is the Island's most important folk event and draws large crowds in July."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Quartu Sant'Elena", "description": "A town located in Sardinia, Italy, known

With almost thirty thousand inhabitants, it is the eighth most populated town in Sardinia. Selargius is part of the metropolitan area of Cagliari, practically joined to the capital city. Perhaps of Roman origin, in the Early Middle Ages it was Kellarios, from the Latin cellarium (agricultural depot). Work in the fields, the town's historical activity, lives again in the agri-food products: wine, particularly Monica and Nasco, homemade bread and pasta, local almond pastries (macaroons, gueffus, pistoccus), Is pardulas and the very famous Selargius capers.\nIn the Aragonese period, the municipality was a huge fortified 'barricade' defending Carali: a square with sides 200 metres long and a moat corresponding to the bed of a torrent. The old town centre preserves its memory, consisting of Campidano houses, built with ladiri, raw bricks, and featuring large portals, courtyards and covered loggias, Is Lollas. The most beautiful and well-kept ones are in Via Roma, where you can also visit the seventeenth century prison of the marquises of Quirra.\nThe ancient religious buildings are the little church of San Lussorio, a gem of Romanesque architecture dating back to the 13th century, far from the old town centre, on the border of Monserrato, and the church of San Giuliano, dating back to the 12th century. The sanctuary has Romanesque forms, particularly the facade, which is preceded by a portico and a central nave with a wooden roof, and an unusual charm: it is located in an evocative corner of the town centre and appears to be standing still in time. Next to the spectacular red brick tower-chimney of the former distillery of Si 'e Boi, now a cultural park, stands the current parish church of the Beata Vergine Assunta, dating back to the 15th century and remodelled in the 17th century. It features a neoclassical facade, a tall bell tower and a large dome. Inside it, there are various works of art, among which the main altar made of multi-coloured marble. The patron saint is celebrated on 15 August, Ferragosto, while St Lussorio is celebrated at the end of August. Another historical church is named after St Salvatore. The churches and the old town centre are the setting, on the second Sunday in September, of the Ancient Selargius Wedding, known as the Antico Sposalizio Selargino (Sa Coja Antiga), the most famous and heartfelt event. A wedding procession with groups wearing the traditional dress of villages from all over the Island and launeddas players accompany the bride and groom, joined by the Sa Cadena, according to an ancient ritual.\nIn the Selargius territory, there is also nature and archaeology. You can enjoy itineraries on foot or by bike in the Molentargius-Saline Park, one of the most beautiful natural oases on the Island and the habitat of the greater flamingo, and you will discover the origins of the village in the areas of Su Coddu, of Staineddu and on the hill of Cuccuru Matt'e Masonis, where Neolithic artefacts were found, while the sacred well of Santa Rosa dates back to the Nuragic era."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Selargius", "description": "A town in Sardinia known for its agri-food products, historical buildings, and cultural events", "types": ["Town",

Septimo ab urbe lapide, its name was originally a reference to the seven miles that separated it from Cagliari (today just over ten kilometers). Settimo San Pietro is a village of almost seven thousand inhabitants in the southern part of the fertile Campidano plain, hence its predominant agricultural activity. There was a Roman mansio (stopping place) where the village stands, along the road from Caralis to the present-day Parteolla. Evidence of Roman period is found in the remains of an aqueduct. The most ancient traces of human presence in the territory date back to the Late Neolithic age: it is the Domus de Janas of S'Acqua 'e Is Dolus. From the Bronze Age, there is the Nuragic complex of Cuccuru Nuraxi, on the hill of the same name, with a trilobed Nuraghe and a well-temple. At the foot of the hill, the Arca del Tempo has been created and it is a multimedia museum and a centre of experimentation on cultural and archaeological heritage. It consists of functional areas: an archaeological workshop, a recreational-didactic area and a garden of the archaeologists. Its set-up ranges from the Neolithic settlements to landscapes, monuments and history of Cagliari and its vast area. As well as the multimedia content, there is a didactic itinerary that explores the archaeological findings of Settimo, particularly the site of Cuccuru Nuraxi and the worship of water deities (also from other Sardinian temples and wells).\nThe village still has numerous dwellings made of unbaked bricks (ladiri). In the centre, the Romanesque church of San Giovanni Battista and, above all, the parish church of San Pietro, built between the 16th and 18th centuries, stand out. Of the original Late Gothic structure, the facade of the building is still there, as is the nave and the presbytery, while the chapels and the last two orders of the bell tower were added in the 17th and 18th centuries. The nave is divided into five bays, marked by pointed transverse arches. There are five chapels and the last two are so deep that they function as a transept. The others are all different. One is dated precisely, thanks to an inscription confirming that it was built, along with the bell-tower, in 1627."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Settimo San Pietro", "description": "A village in the southern part of the Campidano plain with a predominant agricultural activity.", "types": ["Location", "Village", "Archaeological site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, false]}}, {"label": "Roman mansio", "description": "A stopping place along the road from Caralis to the present-day Parteolla.", "types": ["Historical site", "Archaeological site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Aqueduct", "description": "A structure that provided water to the Roman mansio.", "types": ["Historical site", "Archaeological site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Domus de Janas of S'Acqua 'e Is Dolus", "description": "The most ancient traces of human presence in the territory, dating back to the Late Neolithic age.", "types": ["Historical site", "Archaeological site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": false, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Nuragic complex of Cuccuru Nuraxi", "description": "A Bronze Age complex with a trilobed Nuraghe and a well-temple.", "types": ["Historical site", "Archaeological site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Arca del Tempo", "description": "A multimedia museum and a centre of experimentation on cultural and archaeological heritage.", "types": ["Museum", "Archaeological site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, false]}}, {"label": "San Giovanni Battista", "description": "A Romanesque church in the centre of Settimo San Pietro.", "types": ["Religious building", "Historical site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "San Pietro", "description": "A parish church built between the 16th and 18th centuries, with a Late Gothic structure and five chapels.", "types": ["Religious building", "Historical site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}], "annotation": {"gpt missed": []}}, "triples": {"gpt": [{"subject label": "San Giovanni Battista", "predicate label": "is located in", "predicate description": "Expresses the location of a subject in relation to an object.", "object label": "Settimo San Pietro", "annotation": {"triple correctness": true, "relation from text": true}}, {"subject label": "Settimo San Pietro", "predicate label": "is located in", "predicate description": "Expresses a spatial relationship between two entities, indicating that one entity is located within the boundaries of another entity.", "object label": "San Pietro", "annotation": {"triple correctness": false, "relation from text": true}}]}}, {"doc": {"id": 38, "uri": "https://www.sardegnaturismo.it/en/explore/santelena-imperatrice", "title": "Sant'Elena imperatrice", "text": "Stagno di Cagliari; . Already a port in Punic times, and always a synonym of fishing and salt production, the laguna's importance is now internationally recognised. The Cagliari lagoon is a wetlands area of 1300 hectares just outside the capital, and has historical and natural value. This was the location shared by the Macchiareddusaltworks, where production continued up to the 1970s; Porto Canale, Sardinia's main industrial port; the Santa Gilla lagoon; the Capoterra pools and saIlletta, once known as the Island of San Simone, which was united with the mainland in the 16th century. \nThe wetlands are bordered to the east by Elmas, the airport, Cagliari and its road, rail and industrial infrastructures, to the north by the mouth of the Rivers Fluminimannu and Rio Cixerri, to the west by the industrial district of Macchiareddu (Assemini), the fields and homes of Capoterra, and to the south by a strip of land that separates it from the sea. These borders have varied over the centuries due to land reclamation, urbanisation, the construction of infrastructures, and agricultural and industrial expansion. Its size and biodiversity make it one of Europe's most important lagunas, confirmed by the Ramsar Convention. Its waters, which are 2.5 metres deep at most, are mainly salt water with an influx of fresh water from the rivers flowing into it.\nThe strategic position has made it a port hub, leading to alterations in the ecosystem. Nonetheless, the plants along the shores offer a habitat to nearly 200 bird species, 70 of which remain all year round: herons, ducks, barn owls, black-winged stilts, falcons, gulls and kingfishers. The symbol of the lagoon are the pink flamingos, that choose to nest in Cagliari as well as in the Molentargius Park. You can observe without disturbing them in birdwatching hides located along the main road that runs around the edge of the Capoterralaguna.\nHuman settlements in the lagoon date back to the 8th century BC. Santa Gilla was home to the first Carthaginian nucleus of Carales, a centre for trade and fishing. In Roman times, it became the suburb of Karalis. In the Middle Ages Santa Igia, on the strip of land facing the laguna, was capital of the jurisdiction of Calari and the bishop's seat. Its waters were open to the vessels of the marine republics: a naval battle between Genoa and Pisa was fought in the lagoon (1194) for control of the jurisdiction.

Becoming a fraction of Cagliari in 1937, the Municipality of Elmas went on to acquire autonomy in 1989. Within its territory lies the modern airport named after Mario Mameli, handling the most passengers of all three main gateways to Sardinia, situated just ten minutes from the centre of the capital. Also of interest is the military airport, thanks to its history and architecture, having witnessed the companies of De Pinedo and Balbo in 1927. The great barracks of the aviators comprise one of the most particular structures, with a helical ramp for ascent and descent. Elmas also houses the most important press centre on the island.\nFounded as a village of fishermen and farmers on the banks of the Stagno di Cagliari (called the Laguna di Santa Gilla), its most attractive naturalistic expression is where the flight of pink flamingos can be seen. Today, the town boasts a population of almost ten thousand inhabitants and is constantly growing. The first remnants that attest to a frequentation of the territory date back to the late Neolithic period and to the Nuragic Age. A few steps away from the Punic and then Roman Carales, the first settlement stood on the banks of the lagoon, the area being a strategic point for trade and cultivation. From Roman times are remains of houses and perhaps a temple, with numerous findings of limestone and marble ashlars, columns and mosaic tesserae. In the Middle Ages, the area was inhabited by the Benedictine monks of Saint-Victor de Marseille. The Victorians left an inheritance in the form of the Chiesa di Santa Caterina di Semelia, a small jewel of Romanesque architecture, which maintains its original wooden trussed roof, floor and threshold. It stands at the centre of a large courtyard, at its sides the cumbessias (or, novenari - sites where the populations and pilgrims of differing nations congregate for nine days prior to a feast day). The celebrations in honour of the saint take place on the Monday of Pentecost, lasting three days. The medieval settlement on the banks of the lagoon was called Semelia. At the end of the 13th century, the village was expropriated by the Pisans and then fell into the hands of the Aragonese. The inhabitants abandoned it to travel inland, to what was to become Villa del Mas.\nThe parish church of San Sebastiano is the most important recent building of worship. The festivities in his honour take place on 20th January, around a great fire with traditional products offered to the faithful."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Elmas", "description": "A town in

It stands in the lower Campidano plain, north of the Stagno di Santa Gilla, in a territory irrigated by various watercourses. Assemini has been inhabited since prehistoric times. In the mountainous area of Fanebas there are even traces of a Nuragic civilisation. Punic and Roman necropolises, on the other hand, are located near Is Tuvus and Porcili Isidori. A document dating back to 1107 shows the name of the Giudicato Villa of Arsemine, which led to the birth of the town in the Middle Ages. In fact, the layout of the Byzantine church of San Giovanni Battista dates back to the 11th century, with a Greek cross layout, today found in the historic centre. The parish church of San Pietro, an admirable example of Gothic-Catalan architecture, dates back to the second half of the 16th century. Around these are the thoroughfares of the village created by the typical Campidano houses built with bricks of mud and straw (ladiri) and characterised by their arched portals.\nAssemini, famous for its artisan traditions, is a leading town in the working of ceramics, so much so that it is distinguished at an international level. It is home to laboratories that produce valuable artefacts. The working methods are on display throughout the mostra-mercato dell'Artigianato - a handicraft exhibition-market. With regards to exhibitions, in the outskirts of the town there is the Museo di Storia Naturale Aquilegia, where paleontological, botanical, geological and zoological finds can be admired in reconstructions of lagoon and mountain environments. The town also boasts a delicious gastronomic tradition. For example, there are the panadas, layers of pasta containing lamb (or eel) and potatoes.\nHandicraft, culture, cuisine and even a beautiful landscape. Together with the territory of various neighbouring municipalities, that of Assemini extends into the oasis of Gutturu Mannu, 35 thousand hectares covered with holm oaks, mastic trees, oleanders, cork oaks, olive trees and heather, in one of the oldest forests in the Mediterranean. Active walks amongst animal species such as deer, European cave salamanders, Northern goshawks and wild cats can be enjoyed. The park is home to areas of protected wildlife, including Monte Arcosu, the largest WWF reserve in Italy, established to protect the Corsican red deer. Nearby, the San Leone mine can also be found, being part of the Parco Geominerario. Finally, not to be missed is a visit to the Laguna di Santa Gilla, a birdwatching paradise. By extension and biodiversity, this is one of the most important marshland areas in Europe, the habitat of 200 bird species, 70 of which are sedentary: herons, ducks, barn owls, black-winged stilts, hawks, gulls, kingfishers and, its symbol, the pink flamingos."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Assemini", "description": "A town in the lower Campidano plain, known for its artisan traditions,

These are the four lives lived by Casa Spadaccino, a historic building a stone's throw from the sea, at su Loi, a locality in the territory of Capoterra. It was constructed in 1873 by the French mining company of Petin et Gaudet, which held a concession in the inland mountains. It was located at the end of the 'road of the Genoese', an ancient coal merchants' road on which a railway was installed. The building served as the terminus station for convoys loaded with iron extracted from the mine. In the 1930s, it became the heart of a thriving farm, surrounded by vineyards, vegetable gardens and orchards. The area was transformed into a large, colourful garden, where cutting-edge cultivation techniques were applied, so much so that it earned itself the nickname of su spantu, 'the wonder', which still identifies a small village not far from su Loi.\nThe urban development of the Capoterra coast led to the sale of much of the land, resulting in the decline and closure of the company. Casa Spadaccino - which owes its name to its last owner - was abandoned for decades, before being acquired and renovated by the Municipality of Capoterra. Today, the Laguna di Santa Gilla environmental and sustainability education centre is located inside it, along with the Laguna Museum (MuLAG), and it also hosts cultural events and shows. The exhibition is a journey through the natural and ecosystem-based aspects of the lagoon, also known as the Stagno di Cagliari. It also looks back at its relationship that evolved over time with the inhabitants of Capoterra. There are plenty of educational workshops and thematic programmes aimed at raising awareness about the lake environment.\nThe building consists of a single-storey central body, with an attic and an entrance portico with five arches, to which two other buildings, identical to each other, are attached. A large, sheltered garden offers peacefulness and a space for outdoor activities and events. You can combine a visit to the 'house' with an experience in close contact with nature on the banks of the lagoon. The lagoon environment extends for 1300 hectares between Cagliari and the territories of Assemini, Capoterra and Elmas. The wildlife that populates it is varied and fascinating for birdwatching enthusiasts, who can count on dedicated stations: you will see herons, hawks, black-winged stilts and above all pink flamingos, which have nested here for decades.

The sea is transparent near the shore and the various shades of blue get darker as you look further out to sea, gradually becoming a deep blue. When the northwesterly mistral and southeasterly scirocco winds blow, Capitana becomes an irresistible attraction for surfers and also for kitesurfing and windsurfing enthusiasts, for whom there is no lack of schools and equipment rental services. To the west of the beach, there is a well-equipped marina that has two docks and was awarded the Blue Flag in 2020 as a tourist port. In this area, the seabed near the rocks becomes pebbly and, thanks to the transparent sea, snorkelling allows you to observe the abundance of marine animals.\nThere are plenty of services nearby, such as bar-restaurants, pizzerias, hotels, campsites and sports fields. Proceeding eastwards, there is a small beach of pebbles and rocky outcrops near the promotory: this is Baia Azzurra, ideal for relaxing, as it is cosy and private, thanks to the rocky stretches surrounding it. There is a handy wooden walkway, where you can sunbathe and enjoy the view. On the left, at the foot of the rocky spur, there is a part of the coast called the 'cove of the pools'. You will be surprised by the transparency of the water, with its turquoise hues, where white rocks smoothed by the waves emerge.\nYou can also explore the historical and archaeological traces left in the area, by visiting the Carlo Baldi military battery, a fortification dating back to the 1930s, and the nuraghe Diana, a trilobate building from the middle of the 2nd millennium BC. According to popular legend, the Nuragic fortress guards a fabulous treasure: the booty accumulated by a pirate and his beloved, 'La Capitana', who waited in vain for his return, scanning the sea from these shores, and honoured by the local people with the name of the place."}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Capitana", "description": "A sandy beach divided into two coves, characterized by fine

Selargius", "text": "Nuraghe Diana; . The hills and coastline of Quartu Sant'Elena are home to 38 Nuragic settlements, the most beautiful of which is the Nuraghe Diana, dating from the middle of the 2nd millennium BC between the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages and built to guard the Nuragic port. The Nuraghe Diana complex is unique, as the wall enclosing the inner courtyard was designed and built at the same time as the tower toppoed with a tholos false dome and the other two smaller connected towers. This modus operandi makes it unique among nuraghi that were expanded over time and only later were the other buildings annexed to the central tower. The construction technique is also an enigma, revealing unusual architectural and stylistic skills, a quest for beauty and a challenge to the laws of physics. In some places the upper stones are larger than the lower ones and the entrance follows the construction technique of a dolmen with a lintel and cyclopean sides, reminiscent of the entrance to the beautiful Giants' Tomb of is Concias in the countryside of Quartucciu. Excavations and tunnels can be seen around the nuraghe, not by archaeologists or grave robbers, but by treasure hunters looking for the treasure of the Saracen pirate Giacomo Mugahid, who was said to have buried it within these walls before leaving the island in the hope of returning to recover it and reunite with his wife. He never returned and it has never been known whether a treasure was actually found. However, the legend has survived, passed down through the grapevine, of the woman's spirit wandering within the walls of the nuraghe, guarding the hiding place and scanning the sea in the vain expectation of spotting the privateer's sailing ship on the waters of the Golfo degli Angeli ('Gulf of Angels'). In memory of his love, the beach overlooked by the nuraghe was named Capitana.\nThe Diana is not only the inspiration for legends of pirates and treasure, but also a witness to bloody battles between privateers. The promontory at its foot is perhaps not by chance called is Mortorius, a sinister name in spite of its beauty. The thousands of years of history, of which the Nuraghe Diana can rightly boast, extend as far as the modern era. During the Second World War, it was once again a sentry on the sea, this time protecting the forts protecting against sea and air attacks camouflaged in the ruins of an old tuna fishery. At that time only the main tower of the nuraghe emerged from the hill, which was reinforced to build a sentry box. In the 1950s, after the end of the war, excavations began that brought to light a trilobate nuragic complex with a unique architecture created by the ancient architects, which the touch of modern history has not altered.\n"}, "entities": {"gpt": [{"label": "Nuraghe Diana", "description": "A Nuragic settlement dating back to the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, built to guard the Nuragic port.", "types": ["Archaeological site", "Nuragic settlement", "Fortress"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true, true]}}, {"label": "Late Bronze Age", "description": "A period of time in human history, characterized by the use of bronze tools and weapons.", "types": ["Historical period"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Early Iron Age", "description": "A period of time in human history, characterized by the use of iron tools and weapons.", "types": ["Historical period"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Nuragic port", "description": "A port that was guarded by the Nuraghe Diana.", "types": ["Port", "Archaeological site"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, false]}}, {"label": "Tholos false dome", "description": "A type of dome that is not a true dome, but rather a corbelled vault.", "types": ["Architectural feature"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Cyclopean sides", "description": "A type of construction technique that uses large, irregular stones.", "types": ["Architectural feature"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Giants' Tomb of is Concias", "description": "An archaeological site in the countryside of Quartucciu, characterized by a dolmen-like entrance with a lintel and cyclopean sides.", "types": ["Archaeological site", "Dolmen"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Saracen pirate Giacomo Mugahid", "description": "A pirate who was said to have buried treasure within the walls of the Nuraghe Diana.", "types": ["Historical figure", "Pirate"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true, true]}}, {"label": "Capitana", "description": "A beach named after the Nuraghe Diana.", "types": ["Beach"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": false, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Privateers", "description": "Individuals who engage in maritime warfare under a commission of war.", "types": ["Historical figure"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Is Mortorius", "description": "A promontory located at the foot of the Nuraghe Diana, possibly named after the bloody battles between privateers.", "types": ["Geographical feature"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [false]}}, {"label": "Second World War", "description": "A global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945.", "types": ["Historical event"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Tuna fishery", "description": "A place where tuna are caught and processed.", "types": ["Fishery"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": true, "type correctness": [true]}}, {"label": "Trilobate nuragic complex", "description": "A type of Nuragic settlement characterized by a three-lobed shape.", "types": ["Archaeological site", "Nuragic settlement"], "annotation": {"entity correctness": true, "description from text": false, "type correctness": [true, true]}}], "annotation": {"gpt missed": []}}, "triples": {"gpt": [{"subject label": "Nuraghe Diana", "predicate label": "guards", "predicate description": "Expresses the action of protecting or watching over something or someone.
